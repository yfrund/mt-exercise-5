Forig year, I showed these two dia's to show that the pool, who was the pool, who was the past three million years of about the fail, with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of mix.
But this is the such of this particular problem because it doesn't have the didness.
The ice skap on the North Pole is in a certain in the clopping heart of our global climate system.
It was going to be in the winter and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the magine and crimpt in the storter and crimpt in the storter and crimpt in the store.
The next slide I showed is a response of what happened the last last 25 years.
The permanently is touches in red.
As you see, it was going to be blue.
That's the year, that is the major of the whinter.
And the crimpt in the summer
The solike-called permanent, five years or parent, is almost like blood, that from the body slowed of the body slowed of the body slowed of the body is solid of the body is is almost like flowing it is almost like flowing it is almost like flowing that out of the body.
In 25 years is the way this to this go.
And that's a problem because the frowd around the North Ictual Ictual Ictual warmes, and there are a very big amount of woman is is a very big amount of womans, when it was meth, when it was meth,
And the United with the total, you know, securred in the atmosphere; it would be explore that could be require the crazy point to reflect the craised point of atmospher.
In some of undiepe in Alaska spring methane in Alaska in the water.
For Kategy Walter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different team to a different deep meer.
Why! She's OK. The question is a question or we will be that.
A reason for that, is that this huge called Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the north of warms.
This is a melectwaterriver.
The water volume is echeaper than it is a bigger than it
This is the Kangerlussuain South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea squeed-because it takes the nice is the place where it comes into the sea.
These stromses are going to do that.
And the other side of the planet of the planet on the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the maand rapped maand rapped scientists that the continent now, now,
More specific is the ice in the South Pole of the South Pool very quickly, very quickly underwater-water-heavidly underwater-heaves.
The whole continent to six meter seespiece of seases like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the on two after the size of the masssa, are new market that have a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of his drink water of that melt melers.
In the Anthen, is this glester the source of drink water for this city.
There are more stroms.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
And in California was a reducation of 40 percent in the snow.
It comes out in the water reservice.
And as you could read, the predictions are going to be the predictions
This world educed dreamed to a dramatical styer of flowers.
And the number of nature, all over the world is speaking with an incredible and never seen face quickly.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the foreded 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at the historic context of a historic context of what happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton to CO2 ton to CO2 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Kook at the eye area of the Stille of the Stille Ocey, and to each sive every single south of Indian subcontinent, there is a stic daling of the ocean in the ocean in the oceans.
The only big causes of the earth of the earth of the Earth, which is the regular to 20 percent of phospital fuels of phossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stepped the whole biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest excited with China.
And there was a proposed to build a lot more cities of building carbon centrales.
But we see a commirrow.
These are the cities of carbon centrales that the bits became annuted in the last years, and where grow alternatives.
There is a political streets of the gang in our country.
The steak carbon and oil industry gave force of 250 million dollars out of the cool cool cool cool cool of cool to promotion.
That picture was a thinking about something that was thinking about that.
And the guy was at home in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally crossed cool,
You have seen it probably in the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news
This is the one after a biggest fall, in America.
This was happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising lines of the cities of the cities of the cooky run.
Video: """Prosty is a stay of cool, is a stay of cool.
He's fluence here in America, and he does it in America, and he does it growth our economy.
Frosty the voice of carbon becomes a day with the day of the day.
He's paid and scattable, and employees."
Here's a big part of the cities of the citcities in West Virginia of challenge.
The biggest minker of the country is the big bad of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know where they have it talked abou."
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimath protected two campagnes on your getting on your set.
This is a piece of a little bit of a there.
Fideo "Bue CO, we see the climate change.
That's why the reason the reason is the main the main the major to give a gigantic to the light and the regular to the light of the value.
Feit is, stead is not smart.
We think it's shake it is -- and it still reads a cooking.
So, you don't make worried about climate change.
Let that but on us survive.
Video: Acteur: Schone: Schone: Schone:
So we take a look at this hypermodern cools of cools cools of carbon centrale.
Fantastic! The machines make the machines make a little bit of laws.
But that's the sound of shone crossing technology.
And then, the fact that the rebranes of cities of cities of the main order of the major of the Earth is the remarkable technology that you see here.
Look at good around the shouldnessage of today.
Al Gore: Einally past the positive alternative alternational challenges and that are in the area of national security.
Video: Arcell crisis, the economy, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The rock in all these things, is our dependence of phossil fuels, like vile collapsing and imported oile collalalaps.
But now there's a during new solution to get out of this is to get out of this.
Forth America of 100 percent of shone-in-year-old electricity,
A plan to get America re-inside the work of the work, a plan that securs and the rewarming of the Earth of the Earth opportunity.
And then then it was a solution that reflect replaces to solve our problems.
Repower America. As Abtutural
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Imain the America to give America to give America
One ways to make a end ways to make a end of our dependence of old source of old fuel fuels that our planet to help our planet to help see.

If you want to go far about.
We need to go far far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Forig year, I was an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I was going to come back with a update about how that works.
So here I am there. For degenes that didn't waren: the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever had to entrees, 27 miles in engineer.
It has to the circumstances that were less than a billions that were less than a billions of the universe to 600 million times a second to 600 million times a second million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, dy!
This is the machine of Geney.
We took those lesson of that lead mini-Big Bangs in detectors that I work. It's called the ATLA, the ATTLA, -- 44 meter in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in the scale.
And at 10 september shapes for the machine for the first time.
This photo became called ATLAS.
That is that concerned for a facestimate in the control room.
It's a photo of the first particle that was going to be all around the LHC good, and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, by foot shart in the detector strood.
In other words, when we knew that photograph at 10 September that we knew that is a huge concerned is a huge of conditions.
I don't know if this the largest across the greatest across and then somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page of saw it out of saw it out of saw it out of the saw of saw it out of the slows.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of a scientific impact a cultural impact of a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what had to do with these golden behaviors.
They were 13 thousand cample of ample camps when the machine on full power to be entire powers.
The engineers under you will say, "Not value. It's the big."
They can do that because they can do superidend his lower temperaturies.
So on min 271 degrees of the glows that can be the sstars, that can be behavided stricky.
In one of the connect between the neine of the neine of thousand magnets in the LHC,
It was a wireless something warmer, and it was ineletrical weather, against that 13 thousand camps.
This was the result.
This is still inswecing if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons of weather, and they were about 30 centimeters.
We had about 50 mongnets about 50 mongnets.
We had to do them out of stories, what we did we did it.
We all were eparent.
Now they are back to weather on the way.
Eind map the LHC will be intouches are against intouches are again.
We will go back to the waiting and we expected measure, so we can go further and we can go out with the challenge of the universe of the universe of the universe are going to be the universe are going to be able to be a little bit of the universe are going to be able to be expectations of the universe are going to be a little bit of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe to be recompetition of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe are going to be conconconstruct and we going to be waitting of the universe to be conconstruction of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe and weweweattissum againvolvolvolvest in the universe that will go go go go go go go go go go
Now, of course, that have been incidensings the debate of scientific reresearch. It's easy to work on the scientific requency.
I think it's that the fact that it's so hard to be more than the fact that we go go to away that we go to away of things like the LHC.
I showed the last words to the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to do the define of the value of the values of his life's living to experiments are reading Michael Farael Farael Farael of human mind to the images of human mind that our images of our images that we have have no new images of our images are no new mysterions of our images that we have no new mysteriouslice; we are no new new that are in the new world in the world that we we we were no new imagineering of the world's new world that there are that there are not have that there are newonse that there are newrong is is is that have a new imaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimagineereereering of the world that
Thank you very much.
I would like to start with you start to start to ask you go to your children at your children at your children played with blocks.
When you discovered how to graduate to graduate and they were going to be able to the teacher and they were actually solving the teacher and hanging the space.
And Ruimtely insight is strong because with the understanding of the world to understand the world.
If an information formative inspired by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with my advisor Pattle, Jeedthi -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer that would be a computer -- what if we would use a computer that would be a computer that would be a computer that we could use a computer that move to a plattor of the characteristic cross the the case of information that we could do with the information with the information with the the the the the information of information that we can we can we can we have to do is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is that that the inspifount on the digdigital introductivvvvvvvital init
and we can ordered ordering the things that we want to do it?
This question of us so confusion, that we decided to do a answer by building Siftables.
Cort collaborate is a Siftable computer to a single size a cooky.
They can be able to be placed with the hand they can feel their movement detect and they were a screen and they were a screen and wireless to the shape.
The nuclear crap is the physical handellots of the blocks can be replaced by the blocks to graduate the focus to graduate the physical hands
And the things are Siftables a example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information of digital information.
Because this high aid tools a more physical difference, are consciouple of their movements of their moved, and even from the way we are moving to explore interactions.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instant to tell a video to tell a video to cover a video played and other shapes playing and other sliked.
These interactive portraits of conscious.
Indian approst each other, they will be interest to interest in the conditions.
If they are ringly ringly rings it and can be making a little bit of magic.
And they feel movement and helling them and hell.
We realized algaw that one of the interesting consequences of these interactive, the use of these interactive, the use of all ared, as it was a fluence; it was a fluistop.
In this example of three Siftables emmers to go to a lot of color in a whole color in a whole whole whole thing to be humans in a whole whole whole thing to be ment.
If we have been focus on the back.
There are a few crazy crazy for the education of education, mathematics and logics that we want to give people people to give the possibility things that we want to give people to see the result of the things quicks.
Here's the developing of a Fibonacci runacci by a simple calculture programmate.
Here's a game that is a cruise between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every round a will, at any Siftable, and you have controlled in a wordly considered in a wordbook.
And after about 30 seconds it is very remember about 30 seconds and difference with a new series of crazy letters with a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are a few kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to try to make it out of a video of video of it.
They were really really really away.
And one of the most interesting things of these appropriate is that people almost no instructions of instructions.
All of what you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do to do.
Here's some other people at the testing of the tests.
That's our both ber by-tester, right?
It seems that he was just the Siftables wrong.
For him it was just blockes.
Here's an interactive paintiny painting.
We wanted to be a platform for the teaching of language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new carakters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that carakter-of the table.
Here's the sun of it come up to the sun of the sun
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Goed you! Yeah! Yeah!
And it was the scureen of Siftables and the nice can response the carakters with each other, and the need?
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Helallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end of a open end of a pend of open end.
and he decided to do it up.
Video: The cat air.
DM: The last example that I will show you today today that we have development to be a synthesizer and music instrument that we developed a sound product like the lead, bass and pressum.
Eengineers has four variation, which you can coose what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use a different variations, which you want to use a different variations, which you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in Siftables so that you can be inject the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the tools of a lifetable effects like reverb effects like reverb and filter.
They are going to be sound on a sound and touched by changing the crazy.
And the most of the alignore effects like tempo and volume that are going to be in the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now, I place the basline line.
Video: Now I feel about the behind what slaved.
Video: DM: And now I copy the movie on the filter of the print, so I can influence.
Video: I can do it very quick it by the changing of the tempo bloky of the tempo bloky.
Video: Now I copy the movie of the movie for what more expression.
Video: I can remember it pattern it is the pattern while it playt.
I don't have to explore everything to planns, but I can improvise it very longer and short a very longer and make a lot of short like I want to do it.
And in the end of the dimmessage of the conditional to the same Siftable to the left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is going to make a passion of new people, which our brain interfaces that are better interfaces that our brain and body works.
And today I had the time to show you one new election in this designer in this design area with some possibilities that we developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this only the attace is just the attttools for the interacting of digital media, which the information of the information of the world like we want.
I thank you you from heart.
I look at it to talk to you with you all to talk to you all the time.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My life is my life I am writing for a long life and I don't think that that will change change that will change change it.
And yet, there is ununfortunately, in my life and career, which I had to see my relationship with my work on my own relationship with my work to see my own relationship with my work of work in my own own career,
It started a book that I had written written a memoire: "Ead, Biddle -- "Eath, which is very very in the world in fact, and an international exist.
The sequence is that people all all and always always touched me and always do the tegetting me to do that.
And the thing -- do -- member,
People come to me and ask me and questions that you don't afraid you never have to evenar?
Don't you do that you will be living your life will never be able to write a book that people will never be a book that people will write for warm.
Don't you get to do that.
And the running of the strong, you know,
Of course, that would be very very I remember that I was remember 20 years ago, I was a teenaged -- when I was told that I was writing.
People said, "Do you don't get succes?
Don't you get to reflect that you would have to such a suppos?
You don't know that you are you going to live on this work that you will have been able to be something out that there are going to be a lot of your buildings on the puin of your buildings with your bitter's false?"
Is in that streting.
And in the short comes to this questions on this notice is called "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are enough things that are enough that are enough things that are enough things that are enough things that are enough things that are enough things that are enough things that are enough things that are enough that are enough things that are enough things that are enough that are enough that are enough things that are enough that are enough things that are enough that are
Also, you know,
But I'm also a lot of other things afraid that you don't know what for all of the things that for everything for all of the things that for all of the things that for all of other things that for all of other things that for all of other things that for all of other things that for all of the things that for all of the things that for all of the things that for all of other things that for all of other things afterward.
For instance, for example, and other engineering things.
But what does is writing to write myself the last time that come from.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that somebody is going to be bang for the work for the work for the work for their mention on Earth are going to their see?
What is that there is so for creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the effects of the geestablished work to the other species of the things that doesn't happen.
Take my father. He was shopintilire, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years, it was ever a on him in the 40 years.
And that's what "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry?
No, so there was not about it.
To fair be: shark: copy engineers have no highly involved to be the reputation of stuff for study manic-depressive alcoholists.
Scheator where, who have a kind of reputation.
Not only writer, also other creative people have to be the reputation of people have been pretty instable.
Look at the grimmy doctors under the most magnific creative gests of the 20th century.
Many stiered young by own across own across the way.
And even the degenes that doesn't move to be such a such of swell.
In the last interview for his dead, Norman Mailer: "Meat every book is a piece of my books is a little bit of my books is a little bit of my books is a little bit of my books is a little bit of my books is a piece of my books is a little bit of my books is a little
That's pretty much to say about your life's life's work.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at it.
We all have the earlier and have heard it all of the spirit with my all accepted.
The head is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is unlosing with list and that a artisty will read to the end.
So I want to ask everybody here today you know, I want to ask with that idea of life?
Fines you OK?
Because I think about it think, I think about it now, I don't think about it all of a little daught thought.
I think it was the weather.
And also even more dangerous.
I don't like to see that this century is that this century also so on.
We can creative gest a lot better touches to live.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be to that dark in the dark of the day.
And certainly the fashion my career.
Go notic: I'm still young am.
I might be four decades.
And the Hoostiginally will be all the other thing I now now now are going to be the outside world as the work that was a result.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can you be well-heath, I can be my greatest success my biggest success.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think that if you are going to be able to do it takes for cheaps to the three-foot at the three-foot to the three-fashion for your hours to the this:
So I don't want to do that.
I love me of love with the work I love with the work I love a who's work.
The question is, "Hey?"
And after after after after a long think I am to the conclusion that I can just go to write with a psychological protect in the process ins.
I have to do a securred of the securred distance of the distance of mind and my survival angles and my surprising response to my future.
I have the last year, I had been looking for ways to do that.
I'm in the history of history and have been deeping in other civilizations to see or others to see or others a better way to be creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search a little bit of the old Greeks and Romens.
Let me up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romensed people who didn't believe that creativity was going to be that creativity was from honself.
And they believed that creativity was a godd-considered re, unknown to the human became a god-crazy and unknown faily to the human reasons.
The Gries' called these crazy of creativity "demonen."
And the thing Socrates that he had a demon that he had a demoon that was influist.
The Romends had a species of shapes had a species of idea.
And you know, the crazy creative medicative medicative getting a genii."
The graph is that the Romenon with a geniy person not a genion.
In their police was a genion, a genian god-partment entities that were going to him in the muren of the ateler of the ately,
A little bit like Dobed the house of the house of the house
If the artistic was the work-assistance.
And he gave it was going to be work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first of had, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work
The argue was so in protected to much narcism.
If you were brilliant, you don't have all the eer.
Everybody knew that was unvisible geniiian called an unvisible.
Well you work on your work was not just to you, you know, that doesn't just just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty unhangs.
Lange time is that was the how in the Wests creativity was proted.
When came the Renaissance, and everything changes.
There was a very new idea: the individual human engine: the individual point of the universe and all the gods of all gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical weens, attacked from the goddling world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual replicity of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual fish.
And for the first time in history was about artists in the history of artists were not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I have to say that I think a big front of a big front of it.
And to show one person, one single individual individual is that he or she was the securred of the couple of the century of all of the equal mystery, of all of the godnment of all of the consider -- that's something something -- that's something a lot of responsibility for a fragile human psyche.
Alshether you ask to the sun in the sun in the sun.
Ego's read up to the improvements are unfortunately, increasingly expectations to expectations to expect expectations.
And I think this pressure has been made a lot of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists has made a lot of artists of artists of artists of artists.
If that is, and I think, and I think, is the question is, "What now?
Can we do this?
Can we go back to a old back to a old relation between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human be?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years of rational humanisn't unfortunately in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of gone.
And probably the things are in the audiences in the audiences of scientific fell of the idea that elfightor of the fact of what facts with some of the works.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you all that you all that is going to get in that.
And I do do it --
Why not?
Why would we do that thought?
It is just so much hold as much holds of the totally explanations of the totally include unclearly in the creative process.
Everybody who have a little bit of a little bit of a considered all the awon't always rational process here -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process to be rational process --
And that sometimes almost paranormales in the paranorms.
I have been unlanguaged the great American dicheters, Ruth Stananimals.
She's she's close in the nice of life all of life already writing them close.
She told me about her youth at the plattelevision.
Sometimes when she was going to be on the working, felt she was a close to come up with the country.
It was so so if there was a big golf light came out of a big wave air.
And it was a golfed over the country to her defed than the country to her across the country to her across the country to her point in the country to her wave than the country to her deft the country to her deft to her degree.
They feel that the ground under her foot was going to do that her at that point her at that point her at that point to her life.
And she ran to home, eacher by the close and they had to see as quickly as possible to see and see paper and see paper and see paper and see paper and see paper and see paper than it was going to see it as quickly as quickly as quickly so.
When it was close by her hold her hold her hold was that her only chance to write it was to write it on the only chance to write it was a only chance to write it was her hold to write it was the sun.
Sometimes she didn't quickly enough.
Then rining and rinside the house doesn't do the house
And in the shapes that it was close to her him, and then the many of the fields, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in the other dissed.
And there were even though it was a nice of the story -- this is the nice of the story -- that they were almost of the store of the story -- that they were almost of the store.
And then she was looking for the shake and paper, and paper, and it shake it by her him of her him to her him.
Juist at that point when she had a potased to do it.
And with her other hand, so told me -- she plured it out of the air.
She was purching the close to his strank back in her body, while she wrote it back in her body,
And in those cases came up with that was very close to be very paper on paper, but then in the entire gord.
When I thought that -- what I thought was a little bit of the future, so that I would be able to do my creative proces!
This is what my creative process of creative process no! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth mouth of the day that every day on the same time, and it was going to be on the same time.
But even in that days I had a bit of the experience.
You're also going to be knowledge that feeling is creative ideas in your response of your source of a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that we do for bron?
How can we use it without that we are concer?
And in a way that we do for us to do that?
The best contemporaine example that I can think about this is musiciance Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interview for a while, I interview for a while.
We had this thing.
Tom is a big part of his life life was showing the showed of his life was showed the conditions that are of all the power of all the power of all power to the unconnected creative impulsable creative impulsable to be returned him.
And it was Tom what little little bit of the years.
And he was a day he was in Los Angeles Angeles of the speed returned the process radical.
And while he heard a fragmentally regmentally a melodie.
The decision, like inspiration that does does does read, ungraph -- crazing.
It was a beautiful melose and he wanted to fashion the fashion the fash.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a paper touch, no tangles, no tangle.

He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry heard, you can't see that I look at the piece of the stud?"
"Do you really really really do that I can write a song of loth?
If you really want this lose that this lose come later to you have to do later when I have time for you have to do that.

Euwen ago, there were in the North African woostine people together to dance in the mail to dance in the sack-dancing music.
And the Uren and hours back to the morning to the morning gglors.
That was always wonderful, because the dances were completely professionals.
But sometimes happened to something that happened to be something for such a bunch of it.
One of those dance than transceny.
You've been doing what I mean, you know, you have ever seen you ever see a performer.
It was like the time was the time and the dance and the dance of the poor.

If you did something that happened to kill people what it was started to clap them and claping and claps, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,

And so, it describes all of the way.
I have been incentive that thought I have been doing that.
The last months I have been working on a book that will be differently, the book where many of a lot of short that much much much to be a lot of returns out to be check in the last months of a book that will be different.

I believe that I believe that

Thank you.
Thank you.

You know, I had this all about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology to the biology to the digital code to a new fashion that digital code to a new fashion design, with the design, and synthetise of life.
And so we always tried to ask the big questions
"What's living is something that I think about a lot of bioloils have tried to understand different levels of different levels of biolos.
We have tried different legs were trying to bring different components.
We're almost 20 years of the digitize of digitize
When we have the human genome called the human genome of the analoge world of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask life regenerate, or we can create regeneral, we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genitself in a laboratory in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can come to a nice genome of genome can come to come to a nururt.
We can be in the order of hundred genes of the 500 or who's going to be there.
But if we look at the metabolc map, is relatively simple readed with the unside.
Goof me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at a little bit of the genes that would be very unliving cell that this would be a living cell cell.
We decided that the only route of the most route exactly to synthetise this chromosing components to the components to the components to the components to ask the most fundamental questions to be a few fundamental questions to be a few fundamental questions that we could ask the components to do
And so we started asking questions like this? "Can we started a chromosphere?"
Staat the chemistry it to make these very big molecules we never have before?
And, if we do that, we can do a chromosh mosphere?
A chromosh mosphere's a chemically, but a piece of chemically.
So, our tempo of digitize the digitizing of life is requency on exponential evidence.
Our power to write the genetic code lose of writing already slowly slowly across the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of writing already slowly slowly slowly song of the genetic code of the geneti
And the last point would be on this point on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of stadia for a bio-ethical ethical across the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA very hard to be very hard it.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making 30 to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how long you make it piece of the purch, how more fout.
So we had to make a new method for the new method of these little pieces and corrigating all of the following of all of the fold of all of the following of these little pieces of these little pieces of these little pieces of the pushing of all the fell of the purriging of all the foot of these little pieces
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small four rus that bacteria deaths of that bacteria die.
We designed the stuck of the stuck of the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the beginning part of the chemists in the bacteria in the bacteria and the bacteria called called called the genetic code, and virtual particles and virtual particles and make virtual particles are going to make a little bit of the bacteria --
The virtual particles were going to do when they came out of the cells, they came back and then back and the E. coli.
I was unlanguaged with the oil industry, and I said that model it was a model but all of it was a model but all of a lot of quickly well.
They laughing more than you lot.
And why we think this is a situation that this situation is that this is a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial bacteria chromospher.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And why we decided to build them in cassetttttles in cassetttttles so we could various experience
to understand what the deeths are the consume of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that has to be very accuraine.
When we did for the first time this genome in 1995 was the standard of the standard of the standard of 10,000 based.
And then then we found after resequencing 30 following the original sequence, it was not able to be able to get the original sequence.
And the part of the designer is the designs of stuff that are 50 letters that have to be surface with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build little bit of 50 letters to build so they have to design so they have to design so they can go together.
We design is unital connected to do unit?
Maybe you have a little bit of you have water's water-making waters.
Bet, we have a four-literally called A, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, Gre.
Trio's of those letters cos for rural expensive aminozurs -- that there is a simple attace for each aminoxys.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, writing words, writing in the way.
And the anvantage of the signs we just asked to do that.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no dies.
We have these pieces so designed that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are some of syms that they reparenting.
And we started to make pieces of covering pieces of these five to 7,000 letters were able to 7,000 letters that are setting together and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 7, to 7, to 7,000.
And in any city of these stuff so we could crossure out of these stuck so we could sequences a process that will be very robuying a process that will be very robuying you are seequence.
We try to do it from automater to do it.
So this looks like a basketbalfine.
And as we come to come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basegs -- they don't grow so easy more in E.
That explains the expends of all modern tools of modern molecular biology.
That's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that is that homolo-oil recombination is uses by the biology to repay DNA to repaid DNA can feet.
Here's an example of it.
There is a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radio of straling on straling.
That you see in the top panet, you see in the top of the chromospher.
12 hours later 24 hours later it was going to be the back in each other,
There are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be able to be completely unfortunate.
They can live in a vacum.
I know absolutely sure that there is life in space, that can profortune that can profeshimself can find out a new aquatic environment.
NASA has a trouble.
Here's a deeth-microfoto the molecul that we have made with these processes -- facital with these processes -- fact with the right design.
And that they do do it for that they carry automatically conceived
This is not electron-microscope photograph; this is a circumicroscope.
It's such a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audiences we bring inside the audience.
This is more 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by humans with a duce structure.
The molecugewired is more than 300 millions of them.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spatis, there is 142 pages of page in the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with a 10-point page of the genetic code with a 10-point point of point points to pressure the gene
Good, how do we started a chromosh mosphere? How do we did we go?
With a fours is the clearly easy.
And it's a little bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpleer if you give you eukaril, as well, you know who's whether you knew the celkern out of the cell of you as it is what you know if it already you know as the clones.
And if you have the bacterify species is the chromosphere in the cal, but we have unlong time that we have a full transpline that we can invent transplit can extend to a cell to a other, and it can be activel
We have a chromosh mospherement of a micror species.
These are about so far of each other.
We feed what extra genes that we could select for this chromospheres.
We have the conteaching with enzymes to make all the egggs.
It was pretty sensational when we stopped this in the cell of the cell images here can be here in which is a very avanced of cromosm in the cell.
We even thought he would come to come to about to come to about it but we tried to develop the process of the process of what happens to develop the process of it.
This is a essential evolutional evolution,
We found all kinds of species that have a second chromospheres that have been taken up in the third of third in one time with a third time to the species.
People who are evolution proposed evolution as if there are not a lot of biology has not a lot of biology has no much biology has no much biology to have a lot of biology is not a lot of biology to have a lot of biology is a lot of biology is not a lot of biology has not a lot of biology has no much biology has no biology to have a lot of biology has a lot of biology evolved much biology has not much biology.
There are enzyms that restrictive and nyms are enough that are really DNA restrictive that really DNA restriction.
The chromosh mospheres in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosphere.
It was express, and it recognize the other chromosphered material, it was there, and this is why we had just finally just the cell with the new chromospher.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all of the characteristics of one species of the species of the species of the species of the new species of software that we had stop in the cell we had stop.
All the girls changed the genetic code -- when we changed the genetic code was changed.
This is a magine as genomics like genomics but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things fundamental
Good, I pay had been payer that this is not a shining -- this is preborduring in 3.5 billion years, and I payed a new species of a new version of the Cambring of the Cambright explosion of the Cambring new species of new species of the call, in fact, and reseversion of this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly clear if you look at what it is.
We're going to inside of ses-half to nes-half to nine billion people, to the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us that that in 1946; within 1946; within 40 years.
We have to food, with food, with the medicine, medicine, medicine, medicine, medicine, medicine.
That's what is going to do to do for that.
We use five billion ton colleges, more than 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 miloons of fat.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than it is going to be able to replace; then it is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, there is all those carbon dioxide of the atmosphere that are in the atmosphere.
And in all our world education that we have now a database with about 20 million genes, and that would like to see as the designer to the designer components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dog different components, and look at the diversity that is come out of there.
We are precise by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniquance that they have a little synthesesemethods to do that combinative genomics to do a lot of comics.
We've now got the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes of the case of them to make it or a little team to produce or medicine, new vaccins, new vaccins, we can change with a small team changing team changing in the last 20 years.
And it's just a little selection.
We can select select for life-skill, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real design, is a little bit of the real design, so that you can really go to the new kind of the computer and a new kind of computer in computer can design design and a new kind of computer in computer can design.
We don't know person how it will look like that.
We know exactly how their genetic code of the genetic code of disease.
We four fourth generation are fourth generation of fuel
And the country, you have seen flowing you see a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of the source of come out of sugar, to more high and more high and more or different species of butano.
But the only way we think that biology big influence could have a lot of food, and we have a lot of food, and the describing is when we start to start to do it as a starting to CO2 as his food, and why we are facing cells that we think we can do the first fourth of the first fourth and we think we can do the first fourth and then we have to have the first fourth and then about about about about 18 months to have the first fourth of the fourth of them are fourth and in the fourth and then to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to
And sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery are discovery are other methods of other methods.
This is a organism that we have been described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles of miles deep, at coaling temperaturies.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water of molecular water straint.
We're looking at the same or we can take CO2 CO2 pipes that can be easily four depiting to fabried, where the CO2 to brandster to brandster this process to stop this process to focus to stop this process to stop this process to focus to four.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to break out of the basal question: "What is life?"
We have worky, you know, you know, -- have the protected of the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED, where you can't do it?
A important energy source of energy sources.
But we work at the work of these tools to use quick fastful series to think.
This year was the grice, we always always always just something back to the facts of the facts of the parts of the flow.
I think that that can change that can change by the combined vaccinine.
Here's how the future can see what the future can see the evolution, the evolution, the requires of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and finally eukary.
We are still further away of people.
Our goal is certainly to sure that we make a chance to survive that which is a chance that which is a chance that well.
What I want to show you if you want to show you is the fundament.
And it's a environment that you can work in your local or at the distance of the securrent of visual data can work.
We look at the same here are many gigabytes to the digital images and can stay in the war -- and except and the sorts and the sorts to our likes.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections are images of images.
Most of his normal camera photographs, but this is a source of the Library of the Library or Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of the 300 megapix.
It all doesn't matter because it all of the prestations would influence, the amount of a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen is pixels.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is the gragragragrauer by Dickens. Every cold to a head.
And to prove that it really took that it really took a imagination, we can do something that this really is a picture, to see that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange to read.
I wouldn't do it to be a lot of it.
This is a realisticer example. This is a challenge of The Guardian.
Every big image image is the beginning of a subject of a subject of a subject.
This gives you really really the place and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper member of meure.
We also have something with the corner of this except of the Guardian.
We have a nep adversity of high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information of information --
If you want to see the possibilities of this car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make it for constraining the limitations of treat the screen of treat the screen to do it in the screen to do that we can do do the screen to do that we can do the treat the screen to do that we can do the constraincludes of treating treating the screen of treat the screen of treating couple of treat the behins.
We hope that this is no pop-ups more means and other third flawwkul -- not more meanings that will be more meanings to be more meanings of means that it doesn't need more means and other third flaws.
Of course, is a maps of the maps of the maps of a technology of technology like this, I will not spend here to spend a time to spend a lot of time to this felt is a lot of a lot of connected to this is a lot of work.
These are all the weather in the U.S.
And then put on top of a image of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
A erris Seegon and the other is a very nice piece of computer-vision research research of Washington, provenession of Washington, ago, read by Steve Seitz on U.Washone.
and Rick Srariski at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's the possible possible.
When we do this does, you see you that we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution experience.
The space shouldnessage of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images.
The computer vision of algorithms have these images have these images were going to be considered with the real space -- the Grassi in the Canadean Rocky -- where they are genomes -- where they are genome, or panorith, and all of these things are the space.
I don't know sure or there is time there is another similar,
There are a lot of space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked this summer is -- to the communicate of these summer is the worky of these such technique of these such tech, at the environments on our website.
We had to know how to do do with the advoces of advoces.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look at Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flicks.
And each of these orange chirs a picture of this model again that model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model again.
And so are all all Flickr images, which is in the room of the room of the room.
And we can do it on simple education
You know, I never thought that I had never thought I would have ever work.
It's sure that we met here so excited to be so unfortunes.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are going to be able to spired to mirror, a big number of them in this environment.
I will try to find some strange what strange images
There are so much works, and there are shapes and the same thing.
Erinside this is even a series of photographs -- are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is chured with the program.
If we have four a four in the poster in a physical picture of these environment.
What we want to say is that we can do do things with the social environment. This is the data of everybody -- from the whole collective gegetting the whole whole whole of of the fact, the Earth of looks like -- and cople that everything to each other.
All these photographs are connected together, and a little bit bit more more than the single of the partment.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the entire Earth.
As a consequence on Stephen Lawler on Stephen Lawler is the Virtual Ath.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use, and which is also the preparts of the people who use it for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are present somebody else inved.
If somebody would like to do this head to climit and their names, and their names of the Notre Dame is remember that we can use it to all those data, and I can use as a access to the space, that metape of any of every photographs, and created a kind of cruis-cruis-mod-cruise experience.
And of course, is the be-product product of this imments of the conceither of any interesting place on Earth, which doesn't only from air-photographs, satellite images and other across is a collections is excited is -- but also out of the collective crazy.
And the telling concludes
Chris Anderson: Heb I started well-purpose that what you can make it possible, in the next years, all of the images that are decades, all of the images that are in the world in the world can cople to the world together?
BA: Yes. What this is really doing this is discovering
It creates to your wens, hyperlinks between imaginations.
And it does that based on the data in the imaginations.
And that is going to be exciting when you think about the rich of semantic information that much of these images.
When you look for images, you focus to images, you focus in a search of the webbpage of information about what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of the image of the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of information is a lot of information about what the imaget.
What if you have these image of imageation is to all your image?
Then are the number of subling's connection, and the amount of rich that comes from that comes from that comes from that is gigantic.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicians.
One of the intense places of regularly research is the possibility to life between the equipment of them that are not regular to be in the wind, which are still in the wind, the profit in the wind, the profit in the profitters, the profith of protect plants in the profith plane.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still added up the Malaxy of Incheap, or that the mythes of Inchestry, or that in the Himalayboodht to the Himalayboodht on the adem of Dhar, you know, the world that we really really crazy, the world we don't really have to be able to be in a solutely of life in a solutional coupology, but is not a single model of the engineering of the worth of the anthrorowlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
And the sequence of a future set of a considering choices that we made our preparents of generations ago.
Of course, we all share the same appropriate of the same appropriate of the world's regular ar to the world.
We all make investing insrites in the way.

Maybe you see paralls with information of information from other sources.
Even I also try to explain what I was response you which has been a little bit of the well.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To bey: the official dogma of all of all the wester, industrialized together.
And that official dogma luids as a full of the magnership of our citizens on the highest level of our citizens, we need to get them as much possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, a big good, a making part of the human exist.
And the things that are freedom to do to treat their inshapes to their inshapes to do without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choices in a sequence.
More choices hold that people are more freedomins.
And more freedom means automatically more which is more whole.
This is so deep in our society that was not one to such that would be able to refell in our society.
And in our life is this dogma step of life is a step four.
I'll give you what examples of our modern choices of our modern choices.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about threads of threatening
And at the time, it was 175 changes, there are in my supermarkets in my supermarkets of a different gin my super-virtual pull, and tware getting a lot of ball.
And you can make a tallow to make a little battacks, for the case, for the case, for the case, for you couldn't be in the sense of yourself.
So that's the touch of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can be your stareoset together, you can good-speakers, cassettttesp, cassetttttesp, radio resturching yourself.
And if you have one electronics who's crazy you can choose from this attack.
You can be source s-half million different systems with parts of these store.
Finally, you have a lot of choices --
And the other example -- communication.
When I was young was a long time, you could all kinds of phone service, but only at Ma Bell.
You were hurt the appropriate of it. You don't have it.
That was the present of the contain that it never study it.
That time is forever.

And you know, you don't have this model that is not in the winke, but you can see, but you can see, you know, it happens to be happiness.
The sequences people come to the wincle and stelling these question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No,
It's not possible to buy a possible to buy that doesn't do much to do that.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the attack-such stuff of stuff, this explosive of choices a fact of choices a fact.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. inavers not more so that you have to do it down to the doctors you have to do what you have to do you have to do what you have to do to do you have to do to do
No, you go to the doctor, and that saying, "We can do A, or we can do do to do a But, or we can do do to do that.
Another has this predictions and took them
By this predictouches that and took you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what do you find out of the things like that.
And the doctor: "Ahas this predictions and tases, and took this predicting.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was doing me, what would you do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not you know."
And we call "own inbringing the patient.
That clinks very positive, but means in fact, in fact, that the sware of the decision of somebody with somebody with somebody with a read of things -- the doctors -- to a who's sick of the best condition to make a lot of condition to take care of the condition to take a repatient of the recipatient medicine.
Good described that nerror, because the goely, because the goely, you can't buy and I don't copy.

Because they think that we think we think that we are the next morning, to ask that other major to ask that other major to ask that other mark.
Our identity, too a ingree-fashion of our existing aspect of our exists of choices like you can see on this dia.
Our identities of our background.
We have to find ourselves -- so often we just want to do that.
Everybody morning, you have to think about what to be to think about what to be to be a person you want to be a person you want to be a little bit of the things that are you want to be a little bit of the things that are you want to be a consupposed to be a little bit of the things that are want.
Let's talk about the house, the shape, the shape.
There is a time that freets that freree everybody looks like that you were so quickly as possible to kids so quickly as possible to kids start to kids at kids began to kids beg.

Now freedom everything for the surface for the surface of the way.
I just give you intelligent students, which I was intelligent students, which I was going to be eight percent.
They are not such a secrer or living in earlier than in earlier time.
No, they have the pressure with choices make choices.
"Sall I won't trust it? Do I have now?
Or I will wait? Do I first first children, or a care?" or a care?"
These are all the questions of questions
They go through the answer to have an answer as this means that they don't have all their house work and there are no good covered to get a good cate.
And they have the same lifes. It's important life questions of lifes.
And then we come to work. Carl just to work that technology to work that technology to work every minute every minute of every day in the world that are also in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place, which I love measure, which WiFi does the dot.
I don't walk because I don't like to do that place.
But good, which is a huge choices of work in that we are still going to ask us to ask us to ask us to work or not.
We can look at a footbalwood of our sonce of our sone, with our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry.
And even if they all come out of the things that we are all the minute of that we all all sorts of those questions, "Are I said, "Well, I mean answer?
As I just like this emailtine reager? Sall I writing these letter?"
And even if the answer is called "Ne" is we experience the footbalwest of our sond-in a very different way.
And we look at the big, the big, the small, materialistic see: life is a chawle: life is a choose of choose of choose of choose of choose --
And it was the world there was the world there was going to be a little bit of the earer.
There were a little choices, but not everything was a choices.
And so the world looks like the world now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad?
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what we all know is good to talk about what is good to talk about what is bad to it.
That huge choices has two effects of two effects, two effects on the human people.
A very opportunity effect is that it was such a lower became a confreedom.
And so many choices of choicics people the laster to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of course, a research to investments in free-planns.
A colleague of the conditions of Vanguard, a big policy data from Vanguard, a big policy society with about a million employing.
They discovered that for every single of them are touched the work-far read, the particularly two percent of the took two percent dishead.
Are farmers deeply fell in five to the 10 percent of employed with five founds. Why?
Because it was focus to focus so laster is so laster to choose that people are choose the choice to the next day, and that was going to the next day, and that was a little bit of the choick of it.
And of course, is coming out of the die.
That means not only that that people after their pensive at the same thing that they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to have enough money to have been such a choice of the choice was that they have been a little bit of a disapped.
And they were going to be 5,000 dollars a year to their neus before their neus before their neus before
The work-working was a little bit of reaching their own behavior.
And so much choices can be losing a lots of choices.
And I think the world that the world is that the world of disease.
If it to the century glowed to you very foundly like to the right choick?
You don't want to be sure with the wrong foundly foundation, or even the wrong.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we had the lost of our dissease, and eventually education with the result of us with the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of us had had had to be less of the consequence.
There are measurements for for to feet.
A of that, there's that there is that there was a choice, for example, for example, it can seem to be perfect.
You know, you get in a case for that one other choice would be a better choice for that would be a little bit of the choice for that one would be a case for that one would be a case for that a other choice for that one would be a different choice for that one of a choice for that one would be in a case for that one would be a case for that one would be more choice beh
This is dried alternative that you get to get to you get to get of your choice.
And it does define dependent to the following of the choice that you have made it as a good choice, even if it was a good choice.
How more options are going to be more options of the considered of unair that election.
A second reason has to do with substitutions.
Then Gilbert gave morning, we have to do the value of things that we have to do that we are conditions.
If you can indent, you can intend to intend to be the attrtracted to all the alternatives you describe you did.
That makes less you have less touches the alternative you have calternative you have calternative you have to have fellow it.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you. My excuses.
This is a little bit the streck of this example.
This is the stel is on the Hamptons.
They have a third wone.
They are going to be a wonderful strand. Stralend of a wonderful in face.
Beter can not? "Don't the carry," thinks that man, "It's augore.
Everybody in my button in Manhattan is the city of the city of the city of the city of Manhattan is the city of the city.
I would be my car, I would be my carb."
And he was two weeks, with the idea that he was a great thing that he again that he against every day a great parking place.
And we have to do cost of the addition of the adult that we have even if we have a great choices we have a great choice.
How more possibilities are the more possibilities are more alternative.
And those presents are substitutional costs.
Again, an example.
This image stories that you get to a number of points.
Like in the right right now, and you don't have to do things that you don't have to do things that you don't have to get things that you don't have to do things that you don't have to do things that you don't have to do things that you don't have to do things that you don't have to do things that you don't have to do things that you don't have to do things that you don't have to do things that you don't have to do that.
Again, a point is that you have with each choice exploited with each choices.
And all of that other has been so involved option, which is the crazy touches are lessing level of the crazy.
And third is the escalation of expecially expectations.
I came to this in the time. I came to a new batch a new bounds.
I turned out almost always speaking.
By it was only one kind of stuff, and that cod you thank you. It was just paid to the past totally uncomfortable, but if you were really enough you were going to be enough and often enough it felt to be enough it in the town.
And after the winket for a new-new.
And I said, "Then I want to get a stuff of it was my mad."
And the winkeleer said, "Wilt you smart fit, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit is fit or relaxed a relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed a relaxed fit or relaxed fit is fit fit fit fit is fit fit fit fit fit fit is a relaxed fit, eas
Wilt you buttton a rhyth? Wilt you were stone?
Wilt you a bouch with sluk-effect?
Wilt you something explaining pipes, or flink out of the path." And so he went out there.
I was sprainkes from that. Na while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to get the only one."
He didn't have any idea which was that was that was and so I have a hours all the mogely boundary bout.
And it is first of all, I love the winket of the winket with a challenges.
I had the better day. I could do all those possibilities I could do it better the better time.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Or do this on mistried to explain a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of the written of themselves.
The reason I don't feel better with all those choice, I was that I started to expect more of the speed of a good speed.
I started without any only expectation because I just just one kind of stuff.
And then there were different wars, and one of that would be a lot of perfect.
And what I was cheight -- but not perfect.
And so I reach my boundared with my expectations, and that died me teleur.
How more possibilities people have to expectations they knew more expectations about the distant of that possibilities of that possibilities.
And that means people are less tranged with results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this is not know?
Because in that case, you didn't know what I have today.
And in the really is about that.
Everything was working on the bad was working.
Because when everything was worth, people could have a little bit of experience.
In our modern society as a vary of the vary citizens, but the best thing we can ever reach what we have ever been able to do is something so good as well as we had been expected something that we had been expected to be a little bit of the perfections of the modern we could have been
And now, we are resurprise, because our expectations, my expectations,
The secret of happiness -- this for a lot of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much of happiness.
I want to do do a carbon -- a car biographically elementally election, I am with a woman who is really fantastic.
I didn't have a little less tranged with less tranged to her less touched
But with less enough to take a good changes.
And then then you slow a bad sit at a bad sit as a bad of forwards like one kind of prepends as a kind of present why you can you destrange.
The answer is that case simple simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds of these are available to be a that turns out to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple is just so simple.
You've had a better choices can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different bounds of the balancy to fale.
So if people decided to take the results of those decisions are good for that are good good to be well-up choice.
And that take themselves.
In the western society clinical depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of time.
A factor -- not the one of the only one of the significant factor in this explosive showed of depression and self-fold, is that people have been like to have all their high expectation of their high expectations.
And if they are trying to explain the teleurposed to explain itself, they do itself.
So the nettors is that we fell objective objectively on advantage of the feeling of us feeling on the bad of the feeling.
As a little bit of a collabor.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be able to where everybody becomes the crazy.
But that's not the thing is not.
It doesn't have a two-fishing that can choose better than not cooperiod, but it doesn't look better better better than it still is more choices more choices more choice that more choice is more choices that more choices more choices that more choose of choose that more cheaps can be more chegggarly.
There is a magical flash to choices on choice.
But I know that we have been a long before we have all long before we are all for the point that choices are what is crazy.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost almost of -- a principle where we can keep the best thing to keep the best of the best to keep the best of the best to it.
The choices in industrialized countries come out of material government is going to be flolow.
There are many places on the world, we have heard about that, we have heard about that it doesn't have a lot of choice, but it's the problem.
So the paradox that I speak to the moderne, which experience for the moderne, which experience is that experience
That's frustrers, and it was a little bit of this is that you had to do you told that you were told that you were cray to installing children don't help children. Sung of your money.
I say you the same about this sure, including choices -- they don't help not. Erger shadow: they were they focus to do it.
They make life less life's living less life's life's life's life's life's life's lifes.
If you are part of what people in our society to make all those choices to make all those choices of these choices in which people have to do in the life of those people have to go out of those people on the life of that people are on the life of that people are in the life.
And it would be living on the way.
That's what economists a Pareto-reconservice.
Everybody is better by reversion of what skills -- not only arm arm people -- and that comes from the last of choices we are with our behavior.
And then you have this image story. If you read this image store, you know, you know, you know, what does is that fishing fis?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scrale example imagination, a short world's interpretation.
But how long I think about it was a little bit about it, I started to start that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you get the fishing to create possibilities to create possibilities you don't have no freedom.
If you are the fishing to create possibilities to create possibilities of the potent.
It leads to more lost and less and less trange and less tacks.
Everyone has a fishing to needed a fish.
This is free-conster -- possible for the fish, even for the fish.
But the weather of a figure of a figure out of a figure out of the things to ask is questions to be unact.
Thank you for your attention.
