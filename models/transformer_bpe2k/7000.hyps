Fore I was showing this two animals to show that the pools of the pool, who had the pool, who had the last three million years of the fastly of the VS, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the enternal problem because it doesn't have the animals of the icles.
The ice of the North pool is in the North pool in the clopple of our global climate system.
It's called the winter and crimpt in the sumer and crimpt in the summer.
The next anima that I show is a version of what the depplant is a fast 25 years is happened 25 years is happening.
The permanently, is attention in room.
As you see, it comes from darkers out of dark blaw.
That's the journal ice of the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The shaped permanent, five years older, is almost like th, is like blood that from the body, that from the body.
In 25 years is the one of this to this in this room.
And that's a problem because the woman Ictually refround, and they were a very big warmer and there is a very big amount of wombics and felt cools in meth, by micromicromicromicrobs.
And the opportunity to the totaltal amount of atmosphere that would be diverse that would be able to diverse as we can redubble.
In some one-invepe inside Alaska releth-follows of the water.
And then then the winter Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another ondish to a different ondiet to a different ondiep more.
Whoo! She's right. The question is echter or we will be going to be going to be going to be that.
A reason is that this huge is that this humbron" Greenland of the novils of the novils of warms.
This is a smell twaterriver.

40 percent of the world's population of the world's quickwater of that smell of that smell of that smell of the world's follows.
In the Andes, is this glester the source of drinking water for this stage.
There are more stroms.
But when they disappears, it also is the drink water.
In California was a verage of 40 percent in the square in the square in the Sierra.
It's really in the water reservice.
And as you clearly read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This worldwell, this worldwell, to a behavior to a behavior of free frands.
And the number of course, the whole world is insteps with a unbelievel and never seen a quare.
Four times in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the predicted 75 years.
This pattern is completely unfortunately.
If you look at the same storic contexxthan you can see what happened.
In the last five years we've 70 million years we've 70 million years of CO2 avil of CO2 hour-hour-hour-hour-hour-hour-hour-hour-hour-hour-hour-hour-hour-hour----old five years of the last five years of the last five years of the last five years of the last five years of the last five years of CO2 avian away

The only big original warming of the Earth, is the major 20 percent of the Earth, it's refly support of photographs.
Oil is a problem, and stepping the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest challengest of China.
And there was a more support of carbon centrales of building carbons.
But we see a environment.
These are the cities of carbban infortunately, and where growing the birth of the alternativess, and where ground.
There is echecher a political streedge in our country.
The stepping cool, and olie-industry gave million dollars of dollars to promot "shine" and free a cool cool of promots, which is a response of the power.
That picture of me to something thinking.
Right, at me was in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally bone.
You probably see it in the news in the news of the news in the news in the news in the news in the news in the news in the news in the news in the news

That's the reason why the reason is to the major is to give a gigantic behavior, and it response to the light and the response of value.
Feit is, including is not smarkilles.
We find it is -- and it's a little bit of the scree of the circke.
So, you don't make a climate change.
Let that but about us.

So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern centrale.
Fantast! The machines make a little bit of laps.
But that's the sound of share cooling cools of cool.
Our dances the fact that the free of cities of the most important warming of the major of the major of the major cools of the making of the major or cools that you can see here.

Fore I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I response back to a update about how that machine works.
So here is I am I am that there are not waren't waren: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment, 27 miles in environment.
It has to the environments that were less than a billions of the second of billion.
Anorm ambitius, dus!
This is the machine of Geneat.
We took photographs of those mini-Bangs in detectors and this is detector -- 44 meter in the ATLASSSDD, 44 meter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLATLAS in attracular paintacular past.
At 10 september 10 years of we put the machine for the first one.
This picture picture was genomban ATLAS.
That is the care in the controlls in the controlll.
It's a picture of the first particularly particularly of the first particularly of the LHC ging, and with a little bit of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is working on the detector of the detector of the detector of the first particles of the first particular of the first particularly particles of the first particles of
And in the words, when we were on the photographs on 10 September that the machine words, which is a huge of the point.
I don't know or this is the largest future, or done to Google and saw that the internetpage page of the internetpapage of it.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impacts of a science of cultural as a science of the science of the science of the envirtural as a scientific impact of cul
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to make this golds.
That behaviors ago, 13 thousand of camples when the machine on follots of follows.
The engineers will say, "Well, you know, it's going to be a little behavior."
They can do because they can do superidend are on the lage temperaturs.
So on mountains, couder than the space between the stars, that can behaviors that behavior.
In one of the construction between the news of thousand magnets in the LHC, a constructive ancestors a construction.
And it was a blacking, and there was there in the electrical weird to that 13 thousand of thousand of thousands of cample of thousands of camps.
This was the result.
This is still inpressive if you realize that that magnets more than 20 ton weath, and they were about 30 centimeter of the power to the 30 centimeter of the pointon the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets that magnets of the magnets of them and about 30
We having about 50 monkets.
We had to learn them out of stories, what we did we ded.
We all have them all of party.
Now they are backe.
Eind mmers will be the LHC againtace.
We will go to him and we will expect it in your uni or right in your uni or right so we can go to the build of the building of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, you know, of course, that insounces the value of scientific research of scientific research of scientific red.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard is that we go to read that we go to away of things like the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientist Davy, I had to have been moving the inforces of the value of the value of his living of his living to his living his likely Faraday, "Nthing that are so dangerous of human beings to the human beings of our images of our imagineering of our imagineering inside of our imagines are not going to be a new requirrun.
Thank you very much.
I would start to ask you to ask up to ask up to your children when you play with blocks of the both time you play with blocks of your kids
And then you discovered how you to have to take it and involved and they were going to learn to the teaching of the environment, and indeal relationship with space relationship of space.
Ruteleily insight is strong of the world to understand our universe.
If a informaticians inspired by the nest of physical interaction with objects -- and my adviseor Pattion and my adviseor of Kalaniii -- what we would ask me -- what we would ask a computer that we would use a computer that would be use, in the environment, in the environments that would be able to return on the invvvital inspired res of the in-inspired res that could refluence with the insponce with the inspired respired inspired inspired red red red red ree of the inspired inspired inspired respired revevevevevevevevevevevevestststststststststststststitutions of course, with
and you can ordering the way we want to do
And this questions of us so so we decided to a answer to the environment, by Siftables.
Kort society, a Siftable to a interactive computer of a cooks.
They can be able to be infortunch of them and they can detect them and they are involved a screen and they put a shart and wireless and wirels and wirels and wireless to the past and they can get a screen and they can be influence a shart and they can be felt a shart and they can felt up with the hand they can be ind up with the hand they can be flucks, and they can get a pairing up with the ffattttttttttttttttttttttttttiny and they they iny and they iny and they get get them iny and they get them iny and they get get ink up with the momomomomomoveveveveveveveveveve
The nuclear trepreneurbs of physical treately as blocks of the both of them to graduate to graduate the free of the graph.
And the Siftables are Siftables a new ecosystem for the ways of digital inform of digital information.
And that this is a more physical differenttor of course, and even more different, and even of their movement and even of the way we are different new and even of the way we move and a different and more interesting and also a different interactons of the way we are all the way we have to find out of the way we are different of the way we are and even more fourselves of the way
I'm going to start with some simple examples of instance,
This Siftable is instituted to tell a video to tell a video and anothers and others and others and others are playing and others are playing to the anct.
These interactive portraves, are conscious.
Indians will be able to each other, they will be interested to each other.
If they are also ringly, they can be able to become this and can be what support to be a single of them and they can be suming this and then they can be suming this and they can also be suming this and they can also be summers and then they can be suming this and then they can be engineing this and then they can be environment.
And they feel they move movement.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of these interaction, the use of these interaction, the use of the interaction, as it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lost of the wrong of a lost of the interesting of the interaction of the interesting of the interaction of the interaction of the interesting of the
In this example of three Siftables of cells and I can use them to use small in a lege of a lege of a lege of slost of the global gall,
If we have been thinking about what we go back back to that.
There are some of crather of care possibilities for the education, predict and logics and logics and logics and how to give people the possibility and the result of the engineering things to see the result of the enterness.
And here is the developing of a Fibonacci by a simple required by a simple response of a simple return.
Here we show a spel that a cruising between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in every single letter in every Siftable, and case in every Siftable, and case in a wordbook in a wordbook in a wordbook of the words are controll.
After about 30 seconds is very requires a new series of literally considers.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excure to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to make it out of the flowing and a video of it.
They were working on it.
And one of the most interesting things of these futures of these future is that people need.
All of you have to say "Mo's word" and they know what they need to do.
Here are some other people on the tests.
That's our both bittta testster bitself.
And it looks like the Siftables wolds.
For it were only blocks.
Here is a interactive paintiny paintiny of paintiny did.
We wanted to be a platform for the teaching of language.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can put new carran in the scene of the Siftable with that carakters of the table.
Here he shows the sun on the sun one.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene area in the scene ared.
Video: The orange tractor.
Goed though, Yeah! Yeah!
And to the scue of Siftables and the neath of the carakters can response to each other, and the nearaks.
DM: and so are so his story of tell you of them.
Video: Helel!
DM: It's a story with a story with a past of an entire end.
and he decided to the affect of it.
Video: The cat air.
DM: The last example that I will show show Is a synthesizer and likely music and likely music in the left of the Siftables and press the left of the led, and press the led, and press the left of the left and press of the left of the left of the left of the lead
Eenough has four different variatis, where you can see you you can use your wants to use your want.
And this sounds can be inject in Siftables so that you can be inject the pattern itself.
You pick a sound in the pattern by the attable of a living of a living of a likely Siftable effects are living as reverb and movie and movie and movie and movie and movie and movie and movie of a likely of a likely Siftablege of the en
They are become a sound, and they are involved by changed by chancell of opportunity.
And the algemental effects like tempo and volume that are are fugetting on the entire pattern.
Let's look at least that.
Video: We started with a liad of a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a lead.
Now I place the basline line.
Video: Now I feel a little bit of the job.
Video: And now I can copple the flowing of the pressure of the pressed to the effect lives.
Video: I can make it very quickly by the chancell of the tempo bloks.
Video: Now I don't copple the philos: Now the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can remember it resciped the pattern of playing.
So I don't have to explore everything to planns, but I can make improvision, and it's very longer and short to make it very longer and short to make it very longer and short the very longer and short it very longer and short the very longer and short to make it very longer and short the level,
And it was the animals of the dimmbert of the game to left Siftable to the left to left the left of the entire of the environment.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is my passion of new people, in the new people's interfaces that are better interfaces are influence on the way our brain and works.
And today, I had to show you one near elective in this design building design in this design building of some of a couple of developing in the lab.
The dad I want to bring about this is that this is that this is just the attace is to a very new generation of the interacters, which is the information to our world in our world.
I dance you from heart.
I look at it from you to talk to you to talk to you with your all.
I'm writing.
And it write is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life is I decisions of write and I don't think that that will change change that will change change that will change.
And in my life and there is something happened in my life and careering in my life and career, which I had to see my work with my work with my work to see my work to see my work to see my work to see my work on my life and career.
It started a book that I have inlong gs and written a memoire: "Ets, Bidd, Biddnes," Bidd," which is very in the entire world and an international work and an international exister work and an international exist.
The sequence is that people are always always all of the people are always always measures of it.
And the thing -- you know, I mean
People come to me and ask me and ask you and you don't have the success that you can never be a success to evenar?
You don't have your entire life will not be able to write a book more of the book, but never been a book of people in the warm will learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn that people will never learn to learn to be a book more of the write of the people will never be a book of the entire life to w
You don't have a bang for?"
Erunning institution, you know, you know.
Well, of course, I would be very very much. But I was remember 20 years ago, I was a tiener -- I was a tiener -- when I was write to be write that I wanted to be write to write that I wanted to be.
People said, "Do you don't have have not success that you will never get success to get succes?
Do you don't have been describe, that you have to support that you will be able to support that you are going to be enternes?
You don't have your living your life on the work on this work without that there is going to be something that there is going to be able to the puin of your building, and you have been a bitter-bitter-as of falen?"
Is in that streeting.
In the order comes to the answer on this questions on this nois: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm banking for all those things that are enough that are enough of all those things that are enough of all those things that are enough that enough things.
Although of all,
But I'm also a lot of other things band, you want to know that all of the things.
For example, and other engineering things.
But what is write to write myself to the last time that are angest today.
Is the rational e?
Is it is that somebody is considered to their work for the work to their mentation on their mentation?
What is so so much of creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the geestesged of the ents of people at the others of people are not going to happen.
You know, I was a little father. He was short engineer, and I can't remember that there in the 40 years that in the 40 years that he was ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever a bath or he was not a bird or he was not a highly or he was a little bit of it.
And so I said, "You're doing the with your chemistrins?"
No, so it was not about it.
Om fair fair to be engineering engineers have been making the century of the century, not the reputation of mountained to be a mouse of malicive als.
She written that have a kind of reputation.
Not only write of creative people have have been more creative people have been instable.
Look at the grimmal doctory of the most magnific creative medicative century.
For stipped young young of their own future.
And even degenes that doesn't move the self-ord place place to be under their gave gave their gave forwards to be sumplying their gaves their gave forwards to be sumplenty of the point.
In the last interview for his dood said Norman Mailer: "Met every my books is a piece of my books is a piece."
That's notice what to work is about your life.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at it.
We all heard it all of the first ones and have been accepted.
The universe of the dad is that creativity including inlosed with list and that a artists and that a artistate to read to read to read to read to read to and.
So I want to ask everybody here today: You know, you can ask with that idea is that idea of liv?
Findester you that OK?
Because I'm going to think about it is a good about it -- I don't think it's not a pretty pretty daught of daught
I think it's a little bit of the weath,
And also even dangerous.
I wouldn't have to see that this century also so on.
We can creative feet of better attention to live.
I know that it's for me, in my situation, in my situation, without of dangerous to live.
Something in the fashion in my career.
Ga but night, I am another young of young years.
I can maybe four decades of the decades.
And the way of the way I will be more audience, in the outside of the outside world as the work that is the work that is the work on that extraordinary book of the entire book the inside of the environment.
So we're going to be on on the another, so I can explain the wrong of the largest success, my largest success to the largest success of the largest success of the point.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think it's going to think, you know it and you know it in the front of the both of the both rank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to give me with the work I love in the work of work.
The question is"Hoe?"
After night, I think about the conclusion that I can just go through the conclusion as I can go a psychological protection in the process in the process involved in the process inbuilding inbuilding a psychological inbuilding to the process of the conclusion of the conclusion of the conclusion of the conclusion of the conclusion
I have to create the write of the write of mine and my survive and my survive and my survive and my survive forward to my future.
I have been going to go to ways to ways to ways to do that.
I'm in the history of the history and have been deept in other civilizations to see or others to see or others have a better way to help people have to help people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My seettook me to the old Griess.
Let me because it's a long and invitial story.
In the old Greeks and Romen's old Greeks and believed people not creativity of themselvity of themselvity of themselvity of themselvity of themselvity of themselvity of the old of themselvity of the old Griest of the old Gree-enduring of the old Gree-old Griess.
Men believed that creativity was a goddarly re, who was a rere, to the human beings and inknown to the human beings and inknowledge and unknown to the human requickly represents of a godnments of the ments of the ments of the ments of the ments of the ments of the ments of the ments of the ments
The Gries: this decisions of creativity "demons."
And in the way Socrates beliefed that he had a demon that has been influisters.
The Romenening of a spective of this.
And they have been a converse of creative creative creative medicative "genile."
The grappy is that the Romenen's not a genee person on invitial invented person
In their police was a genious of magical goddeliveral entition that are required in the murs of the artist.
A little bit like Dobs of the houss.
If the artists was read the genassion of genassion of genassion
Our crather he work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the way I talk about the first of had, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work in his work
The artists were so in protection to protect much narcism.
If you don't have a brilliant you won't be a front of the eer.
Everybody known that a invisible gence you had hold.
And you know, you get your work on your work is not just to you,
Everybody knew that you have an independent of genion.
Lange is that that was how in the West creativity was proted.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There is a very new idea: the individual ments is the middle of the universe of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical weath, intend of the godnment.
That was the beginning of the rational humanization.
People believity that creativity of the individual influence of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual fider.
And for the first thing in history of artists were about artists that they were a genee and not that they were a genet.
I have to say that I have to find a big follow.
Om one persoon, one person, one enkle individual influence that he or they have the securrent mystery, the essential mystery, of everything that goddelivernment, and it's something that governments is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something much more responsibility for a lot of responsibility of the fragment, and the case of the power.
Also, or you ask the sun in the sun in the sone.
Egos are read to gigantic provions and there are inforforwards are infortunatissues and there are inprestations of exactly peld.
And I think this pressure is the last 500 years artists of artists of artists.
If that's so so is, and I think it's the question, "What do is the question.
Can we do this different?
Can we go back on a old old old of the relationship of the relationship between the ments and creative mysteri?
Maybe not.
And we can make 500 years rational rational mandmanism not to make a 18 minutes of speech.
And they probably have been in the audience of people who are inspiring scientific two-weath, and the idea that free of the partial of artists to inspiring the work of artists and bring higher high-teaching high-teaching high-teaching higher in the idea that are inspiring of artions of artive and the idea that we have to do the idea that figh-felt of the idea that that felt of the ent
It doesn't seems me that I will get you all of them in there,
And I ask it up.
Why nois?
Why would we have that thought, I don't move to the next next to the next next to this?
The fastly is just so much hold as all the other explanations of the totally incluctions that decided to creative process.
And everybody who has been trying to create something has to create -- so in fact, so that it is that creative process -- you know, the creative process of the creative process of the creative process.
That's some of the inside of paranoriginally invitial invitial invitial invitial indeving.
I have inslude the great American andichters, Ruth Stone of the amazing.
They are in the needed in the needed of life. Her lives they did.
She told me about her yourself on the plattold of Virginia.
Some on the felt on the felt of work was felt the slide they have a diverse of the country.
It was so so she said, if there was a big golf living air and living air
And so it was a disight than the country to her to her.
She feel that the foot of her foot to do and wrong that her on that her on that her on the point of her, and they were to her.
They running to home, backward, and they had to see it so quickly possible and paper and paper and paper sears.
When it was a sight by her hold her hold her her hold was that her only to write it on the write on the way to write on her hold up to write it on her hold up to write it was that her one of her hold in the hold on her hold in the free of her hold it on her high.
Sometimes they don't have squickly enough.
And then I don't get running it and calcult it doesn't have the house of it.
And in the points are shoot the seck of her heath, and sek -- in her words -- in her words -- to another diched -- to another dichegle
And I were a though of the things -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the beautiful.
And then she was seen in house and paper and paper, and whether it through her heath, and it through her her her and well.
Juist on that moment she had a potlet to pay
And with her other hand, so told me me she's slight out of the air.
They paid it in his strange and it back in her body, and it back in her body, while they were the surface of the body,
In those cases the case of the gedied in the sense of paper in the paper of paper in the environment.
And then I thought -- what I thought -- what I thought -- what I was so on.
And so I don't works my creative process of no! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, who are every day on the same time, and it is the same time and transforming and transforming up and transforming up and transforming up and transforming up with blood and transforming up and it up up with blood.
But even in that days I have been a though of experienced a experienced experienced of experienced
You will also be able to know it it is that case that there are creative ideas in your operating and free of a sources that you can identify intentificidentific ideas
What is that then is that they are the future?
How can we use it without that we are word?
At a way that we do it?
The best contemporain: I can think I can think of this is musician's music,
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a time shrift.

That was always wonderful, because the dancers were fully professionals.
But some of them very few of educations.
A of those dancers became transcendly.

You know, I have been talking about a couple of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and the discovers of new sets of genes.
We started to start to a new point, we were the biology to the biology of digitalizes to the digital code to a new fashion the biology to the design of life, with the design and synthetissue of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions of questions.
"What is something that I think of the biolos have tried to understand the different levels of biolos.
We tried to have different approaching the back to less imal components.
We're now now now now about 20 years to the digitalizens.
And then we have the human genome of the genome of the analoge world of the analoge world of the digital world of the computer.
Now we can try to ask life we can live life, or we can create life, or we create life from this digital universe of this digital universe of the digital universe of life sumply universe of life environment, or we can create environment, or we can create environment,
This is the map of a small organized of a little organim called called the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genomic that can responsibility in a laboratory in a laboratory oratory of a laborator.
And we tried to look or we can get to a nature of genome to get genome of genome of genome to get it.
We can be in the order of hundred of the 500 or so on.
But if we look at the metaboolic cars, that's relative simplicity with the onze.
Gelese, this is simple.
But when we can look at all the genes that we can invitious that would be very unliving that this is a living cell would read the cell would read it.
We decided to do that the only roud of the environment, to this this chromosphere to synthetissue so we could be able to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions can be a few fundaments.
And so we started asking with questions like "Can we have a chromosphere?"
Staat the chemistry that is this very large molecults that we never have have never seen one?
And, if we can do that, a chromosphere?
A chromosphere is a little bit of chemical including material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizes of life is requires of life is responential evidence.
Our moving the genetic code code of write crowed in lost of the genetic circle of the genetic circle of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code code code of the gene
And our last point would put it on this moment on a exponential curve.
And we're more than 15 years ago,
There were some city of city crather to start with a bio-ethical future, and making the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthess.
There are tientire thousands of of thousands of DNA making 30 letters in lengs, 30 letters in lengs, so how long you make it more follow.
So we had to make a new method for the collect of these little pieces and the corrigate of all of the parents.
And this was our first poging, with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi I’s 14.
That's a little virus that bacteria that bacteria diad.
We designed the stuck of the stucks, the foundly of the flows.
and had a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The spannice part of when we started a inside of the bacteria in the bacteria and the bacteria and the bacteria and virtural particles and virtual particles of global particles of global particles of gs and vironment.
The virical particles were working when lots of the cells, they came back and following the E.
I was unlanguage in speak with the olieviololied, and I said that they had to do that model but I said that they were going to be able to go to the model of the oil industry, and I was unlanguage with the oliefs.
They laught more than yourself.
That's why we think this is a situation is true that is the software are building their own heart of a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much greater of griculture.
We wanted to build the full bacterial bacterial chromosps.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetical cod.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttttttells so we could experienced the cassetttta --
And to understand what the death,
The design is crucial information in the computer of digital information in computer than that digital information in computer than that digital information.
And then we went to the first time this is the standard of the standard of the standard precision of the standard of 10,000 avils per 10,000 aves.
And in the inventually we could resequencing 30 parts of 30 partment, then we had the warently had to start the way.
Our part of the design is the design of stuff that are 50 letters that are to all the other stuff of 50 letters to all the other stuff of 50 letters to build all the other stuff that we have to design so they can design them together to design so on.
We design design in fact,
Maybe you might have some of the ago in the watermers in strong.
Beducation of four letter-letter-letter-genetic code: A, and T.
Trio's of those letters for the run 20 aminozurs -- that there's a simple attackable to every aminoxygen is a little aminoxyygen inoxygen of that literally inoxygen of that literally is a little bit of that literally inozur.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words of the genetic code of the genetic code to do the genetic code to do the genetic code to do the genetic code to writ.
Avanceasily of the endly of them.
Some of them were no dised that there were no diset that there were no diss.
We have these stuckes so we can take them with enzys.
There are enzyming them and in each other.
And we started to start to do stuff of these stuckes that stuck five to 7,000 letters of these five to 7,000 letter, and you have to go from 24,000 letter, to 7, to 72,000.
In every city of the crather we could have a survive that we could couldn't create a process and because we want to create a process is that you can see that you can see the rabbitat.
We try to get the point of automatatisished to calculture.
So this is a basketbalfinale.
And so we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 aves, they don't grow it so easy more in E.
That is the excellent of all modern amazing the molecular biology.
That's why we went to read with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-olo-olo-olo-olo-reparently to reparers, that stuff of calls can feel that stuff food.
Here is a example of it.
There's a organized multiple Deinococcus radiodurants that three million radiodurancy on the opportunity.
That is the following paneel, my path, my path, just coom of the one.
12 ot 24 hours later sect it was exactly like the first of all, exactly like the first of all.
There are thousands of organs that this around.
These organisms can be survive to be sure of these organs.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely that there can be life in space that can exist that can be able to explain the space can find a new aquatically environment.
NASA has been going to see that there are here is a lot of course,
And here is a deterrid-microph of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- fact with the right gist-mechanism mechanism with the right designer design.
And they make it automatically automatically collected to food.
This is no electronen-microscope, this is a microscope.
It's a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope of the microscope.
These are photographs, about a period of six seconds.
This is the audiences we explaining incluence.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic cod.
It's the largest molecule molecule of people, with a dualth structure.
The molecuulged is more than 300 millions of 300 million.
If we would describe the prints with a 10-point literally than there is there 142 page of page page of genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic points of the genetic points of the genetic points of the genetic point.
Good, how do we started a chromosphere? How do we have the him of it?
It's a four-is the such is the clearly easy.
It's a bacteria is the much invitial complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukard, as well, you wouldn't whether you walk out and it is what you know is what you know is what you know if it's what you can know.
And in the bacterious species is the chromosphere is the chromosphere in the cell of the cell of a complete transplantation of a chromosphere of a chromosphere to a differentation of a differentation of a differentation of a differently.
We have a chromosphere of a micromosphere of a micromosphere.
These are about so far as far as people and mictions and mizes.
We foot what extra genes so we could couldn't sell it couldn't select the chromosps.
We have the contempted with enzyming all of the equires of the equires of the equire.
It was women, it was woman when we have this in the cell of you will be the very very avanced graphical images here -- the new chromosps in the cell.
We even thought that he would come to come to come to the process what would come to develop the process of the process of the process of the process of the way from it.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We found all of the species of those of that that have a second chromosphere or a third of thousands of of thousands in one time to the species.
People that evolution are equires of the changes are not going to have a lot of biology is not a lot of biology
There are enzymists that are restrictive enough that are enough DNA verterms that are actually desert DNA verterms that are restrictive that are restrictive that are restrictive that are restrictive that are restrictive to be enzyms.
It was not a chromosphere in the cell was not equire.
The cell -- the chromosphere -- which we stop in --
It was expressive the other chromosphere and the other chromospher, and we had the sure of the cell of the cell of the new chromospher.
He was blue of the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had strainside of the genes that we had stop in the genes.
And in very short time and all the carakists of the ene species of the ene species, and changed of the new species, and it was building in the new software that we had stop in the cell of the cell of the celarens.
All of changes, the membrans changed -- when we were the genetic code -- it was the precise was change.
And this magine clines like genomician alchemist, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamentally DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
And I have been paying a little bit of path, that this is not a short of 3.5 billion years of 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I have been a new version of the Camic explosion of Camic explosion of the Camic explosion, affect on design design in the majourney design in design this digital of design in design design in the majourney of designers,
Why would you do this thing?
I think it's pretty much as you can see it as you look at what there is going to to what there is going to what there is going to be a there.
And we're going to go from ses-en-en-on-half billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context of the send in 1946.
There are three people on this planeetal ...
And for every one of us that in 1940 years in 1940 years of us are going to be four years of there are four there.
We have mother with food with the food of sharing water of short water, medicine, fluence for the summer.
That's a little bit of needed to do that for needs.
We use five billion ton cols, more than 30 billion follows,
That's 100 millios per day.
When we have biological processes in ogent or whate, or which is also to requires to require.
Then of course, there is all those carbon dioxide of the stor that in the atmosphere is really come.
And in the worldwhether we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the designer components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dog components, and look at the animals that is from there is predicted there is present of the animals that is predicted to the animals that is predicting.
We are predicted by a biological reality and our expect of our imagination.
We don't have techniques danced to the pointiny methods to the combination called combination genomics of combination genomics of the enomics of the "combinative called "combination.
We have now now the possibility to build a big robot that a million chromosomes a day can make a day can make a day
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes of the science to optimalizing to engage or medicintiny to producer or medicine, we can change with a little team of team of team of the science of science than the last 20 years of science than the last 20 years of science than the science of science of science of science to produce and including to producer to producer or to producer ening environments of the science of the science of the science of the science of the science of the science of the science of the science of the quices of
And it's just standard of selection.
We can select for lives, cemical or brandster or fuel production, vaccinproductions production.
This is a screen image of what real designer designer designer is where we really really really about the gars and a new species of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the world.
We don't know what it will see will see it out of it.
We know what their genetic code of the genetic code of it.
We read us on fourth of four generation of fourth and fourth of four generation of fourth of four generation of four generation of four generation of four generation of fourth generation of four perforces.
Our gone, you know, you have free to ethanol experiment.
And we have second and third generation that will come from the inside of the sugars will come from the environment, to more and like octano.
But the only way we think that biology can have a big invluence without the food neight, and the describes and the describes and the describes of CO2 as his food as his food as his food and so we are influence on the way that we think that way that we are involved in the way we think we can have been able to be able to require to be able to to reggular entire 18 and inside of the fluence of the fluence of the first way that we are ree of the ently ently entions of the mamamamamamamamamaybe to have
Sunliving and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwhether we have all all the worldwalls have all other methose.
This is a organized that we have been in 1996.
It gives in the animals in the animals in the animals of temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water of molecular water as energy bron.
We can take it or we can take fast CO2 2 and some easily four pipips, where that CO2 to fabried, where that CO2 to froming this process to get this process to sturn this process to sturb.
So in a short time we think we are thinking that we are in the basic question: What is living to the basic question: What is life life is liv?"
We have works, you know, the protect of the petrochemical industry industry industry industry of the petrochemical industry of the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this with TED what?
A important energy source of energy source of energy source
But we work on the working of these workle of these works, to think of these works.
This year, there was the floor, we always always just like the facts of the facts of the fities of the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change through of teforms of teforming vaccinate vaccinate vaccinating vaccinate vaccinate vaccinate vaccinate vaccinate vaccines of teforms of teforming vaccinate vaccinate of teforms that can change
And here you see how the future can see the environment, it's going to change the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eukarkyota.
We are still far away of the people.
Our government is certainly that we make a opportunity to survive that well.
And what I want to show you you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to put in a new technology that we have to put about a year ago. This is Seeds.
And it's a environment, you can actually have to instance with immense of immense data can work with immentally data can work
We look at the right right now, many gigabytes and can stay and it up to stay and it up on the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sors and the sorts and the sors of the sors of digital imagine and the sors of the sors and the sors of the sors of the things like this.
And it doesn't make it from how much information, how big this collections or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images of information.
Most of these are normal camera photographs, but this is a source of the Library or Congress, and sit in the 300 megapixel of the 300 megapixel of the gapixel of the Library of the Liary of the Liary camera is in the 300 megaper of
It doesn't make it all of the prestent of what the prestatished to be invlud, on a third system, the amount of the screen on the screen on the screen on the screen.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a full book, a circle of noise data.
This is the graue of Dickens. Elke is a headvantage of collect.
And to do that it works, and not the works, and no imagination, we can see something that this really really tect that this really is not a picture.
Maybe this is a bit of terms of a little bit of a book of life.
I wouldn't do it to it.
This is a realisticer example of the Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a death.
This gives you really see the place and the experience of a real paper paper or well, or or calculation or calculture.
We also have been done with the nek of these extend of the Guardian.
We have a nel advertention of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information of information -- and we have extra information of information --
If you see the possibilities of these authors you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas as can really make the consider that we can do the constentions of treats of treatmentally four the scree of treatment.
We don't have a popular sense of means and other third and other third -- not more means of the won't be more more meaningingly intent.
Of course are agrands a for the hand is a technology of the environment, I'm going to spent here here is not time to spendly, except that we can be more except to this felt is a lot of behaviolence.
These are all the weak in the U.S.
And the folt on a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is the left on the Web; you can look at the botttomo.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques of techniques.
A ero-Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer fishing computer fishing the University of Washington,
and Rick Srrisci at Microsoft Research.
So this is the left on the Web. It's measure possible by Seadragon.
When we do, you can see this left and the multi-resolution and the multi-resolution experiences.
The space is a single of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the imagineering of the images of the images of the imagineering of the imaginations.
The computer vision of algoritmes have these images are building these images that they are all the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadisi Rockies -- where they are genomomban aths of inform or panorama or porities of purpose or ints and history.
I don't know if there is another time is, other environments and explaining the time.
There are a lot of space are a lot of space.
I want to follow a of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked this such is the challenge of the environment, and the worth of these technons, the environment, with the environment.
We had to learn with the advoces on the advoces so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notruly of the Notruly of Flicket to be able to the enable of people in Flicket in Flicks, and you get you images of people in shirts, and the camples and the campus and equale.
And every one of these orange chestimate a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of the model of this model of this model of this orange of the orange of this orangular display of this orange of this orangular displas.
So are all the Flickr images that are of these space on this way of space are require.
And we can take on simple evidence of education.
You know, I had never thought I had never thought to work at Microsoft would work.
It's about this is so farmers to be so far.
I believe that you can see that this many types of girls are going to spired to spired to springs a big number of them in this environment.
I'm going to try to find what strange to find some strange.
There are so much more concerned by secing and right.
Eries in this six even a series of photos -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notracky that also churposter is by the program.
If we have four poster in a thousand in a physics of these environment.
What we want to do is that we can do with the social environment, now the social environment, on the whole collective several entive memory of the shape of how to the shapes that everything about anything to do that everything about anything to do that everything about anything about the another.
All these photographs are invented with each other, and a very very little bit of the partment.
You have a model that from the entire Aart of the entire Aart of the entire Aart of the entire Aart of the entire Aard.
And this as a folloors on Stephen Lawler's work the U.S.
And this is something that growth in complexity when it uses it uses of the people who are going to use the people who are using the people who use it.
Their own photographs are involving infeel of metapo.
If somebody would like to invites and their names, and their names, and their names, and their names, and they are influence with all that data, and that can use it influence that can use as a fucrather than a fun of these photographs of these photographs and create a kind of photographs and social experiences of these palissue and social experienced a kind of photographphons.
And of course, it's the consider, is rich virtual model of this is envirtual model of every interesting place on Aard, which is not only from the environments and other access, but also also out of the collective and other across the collective collective and other across the collective photographs of the interaction of the interaction of the Internal model of this is environment.
Our telling dances.
Chris Anderson: Heb I started good beginning that what you can make it possible possible to a day; in the next years, all the images that are going to be on on the world.
BA: Yeah. What this is discovering is discovering
It create, the end, hyperlinks between imagines between imagines imagines between imaginations.
And it's called the base of the data in the data in the imagines of the imagines of the imaginations.
And that's getting instance, that is concerned when you thinking about the rought of semantic information which is much of these images of these images of these imaimages of these images of these images of these imagine of these images of imagine of these images of the imagine of these images of the images of these images of severttttttelling of these imaimaimages of severy, much of the imaimaimages of these imaimaimagine of of these imaimaimaimaimaimagine of of the images of the engingingingingingineering of of these imaimaimages of these imaimages of celling of of cellelling of these images of these images of the poiny of semantifulful
When you go to imagine the web and you fer seeing a section and the tect on the webbpage of information about what the images of information about what the images is about what the images of information about what the images of information about what the images of information about what the images of the web in the web of the web page of information on the webbigcky in the webbpage of the web page of information about the webbpage of information of information of the webbbbpage and then you can can can can can can can can can can imaimaginture.
What if you have coped that picture is on the imagine?
And then the number of entrepreneducing and the amount of roughness that is a classical that is a classic. It's a classic.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicians.

I want to talk to you about some of some questional questions, I have been a book of a book.
Maybe you can see paralls with information of information from other fun of the point.
And so I tried to explain some of the contracted that you can have mist.
I want to start with the official dogma."
Om Om to be, the official doggma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official doggma lip of living to the wrong spot of our citizens on the high level of our citizens of our citizers on the possible free free free free free free.
Freedom is a big good, a big good, a making part of the human exist.
And the way of free to free us to treatately to treat a higher spring a higher spring without of third without of thirs.
The ultimes, we find in choicick in choicice.
More choices in that people are more free of people are more free.
And more freedom means automatically more whate.
This is so diep in our society that nobody would be invited to deep two.
And in our life is this doggma step of infour.
I'm going to give you some examples of our modern choicice.
This is my supermarket. A middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of my supermarket.
Even about dress of the point.
And after 175 chances are aid in my supermarkets are in my supermarkets and different care of crather than extra-follow-follows.
And you can make their own dress your telling own dress the case of those 175 species of those 175 species for yourself.
So that's the attacks.
Look at electronicawinles argus. You can see itself-in-in-spitself-player cassetttesp: radiversts radiverster.
And in that environment.
You can have a half million different systems and a half million different systems of those windoctors of those winles of those winks.
You know, you have a lot of challenge of choice.
You know, there's another example -- communication.
And then I was a long ago, you could all all all the phone-animals, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't hurt the future. You don't cood.
That had been survive the predict that it never study to this.
That time is for it.
Toily are very different access of different across of different across
Firal of cell is the diversity is the diversity imments.
These are the cell of the future.
And my favorite is the middle -- that with 3-player, neusharly and crack-fuel fun and crackings of the poverver.
Welliight you have this model not in the winks, but you can see you sure of his face that is going to happen.
The population is people come to the winter and stells these question.
And you know how the answer on that question.
No
It's not possible a possible possible to couple that doesn't do much do.
And in aspects of life that are important, there are more important, is this explosive toward is this explosive toward of choices a fact.
Gealth is in the U.S. It's in the U.S.

At this ancle and naves.
and you have this prevent -- and you want to do?"
And you say, "Dok, what is now, what vins is no?"
And the doctor, "Another this prevent -- and and you have this prevent -- and he was this prevent -- and he took this prevent -- and he was this prevent -- and he was this prevent -- and he tarms, and and took this present -- and and took this prevent -- and he tunately, and it it is the anims.
What you want to do?"
And you say, "Dok, if you would you do me, what would you do you do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you don't have your one."
And we call their invvity."
That clines very positif, but means in fact, that the sense of condition of condition of somebody with somebody with somebody with somebody -- the doctors -- to a life's free that is not the best condition to the condition to decide in the patiengineering to get infortunregular ads of the infortunately is a lot of recentable to requicke.
Good described that nercase that nature groep, and I can not buy and I can't cope.

Let's have it talking about the house of the house of the forward.
There's a time is a time that free everybody there are free that you can get so quickly as possible to the free of children began to children began to children.
The only workly works, with while you was not when and what you are your focused to death.
Now free that is free to the surface of the surface of it.
I give you a little bit of intelligent students, which I would remember left in homized to work on the homb.
They are not dommer or air, or air, in early early time in early time in early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices of choices
"Something I got to have not?
Or I will I wait? Not me me first children, or a career or a career re?"
These are all of questions.
They are going to have a answer to have a answer that they don't have all their housing work and they don't get their housing work and they don't have a good circle of them and they don't have a good cird of the enough of them and they don't have their houses.
And they have the same thing of living of life.
And then we come to work on the work. Carl gave to work on the technology to work every minute of every minute of everyday -- stories in the Randolph Hotelliph Hotel.
There's one place that I love a place that I love love of WiFi it is the got.
I don't explaining that I don't like to me, because I want to hold myself.
But good, that good, which is approaches in that we are still asking us to ask us to ask us to work on the time or we are going to work or not.
We can look at a footbalth of our sone, with our sone, with our ene can, and our Blackberry on the other opportunity and our Blackberry on the other opportunitself.
And even if they all all of them are we all every minute of those weath, and you know, the answer questions of question: "Something I mean answer?
And I like this emailtin?
And even if the answer "Ne" is, we experience the footbalth balth of our son on a very different way.
Where we also look at the grands, the small, materialistic saks, life is a crapid of crows.
And so so the world there were early exciting in the world.
There were a choices, but not everything was a crapid of cooks.
And so the world there are now.
The question is now, or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad it well?
The answer is: "Yes."
So we all know what there's good to is, so I'm going to talk about what is going to be a bad of it.
That huge choicices two effects of two effects on the ment.
A very very explaining effect is that the first ones of works than the first thing than the first thing than becomes more than free to beautiful.
And so many choicick people the laster to make a choicice.
I give you a very behavior of a very behavior of investments in free pensive pensioddly planns.
A collegue of me croad to investment of Vanguard, a big policy professage with about one million working with about one million works.
They found that for every tions of pollution foundares that worked the works, the particularly involved two percent of the particular process of the works.
And we did five foundares death, there were desert to five than five founds. Way?
Because it is the five foundes so laster to care so laster to the choice that people are just to the next day, and that people who are exploring up and that reaching up and so on.
And of course, of course,
That means not just that people after their pensionate of their pensionate and eat because they have not enough money because they have not enough money to have been so that the choice was so much of the choice of them have been working on the choicice.
And they were going to be able to 5,000 dollars a year-year-dollars a year-year-year-year-year-year-dollars a year.
The workly was calculate to their own behavioral connected to displas.
So many choicickly can consuming incluence.
And I think the world there are so on.
If it is to the century, you want to go very flolove the right choice choicks, right?
You don't want to be sure with the wrong of the wrong fone, or even the wrong dress the wrong dress of the wrong dress of it.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the lover, as we were destroy and circles and cut it with the result than it would be less than it to the result than it would be left left as a left of the environment.
There are measurements for that.
A strow of a choice, for example, for example, in the choice, it was not perfect that the choicice.
You know, you would be able to that another choice that one would be a more choice that would be a more choice.
This is droom alternative to make your spired to you your choice.
And then you put it on the follow-in-in-following you that you have been a good choice, even if it was a good choicice.
How more options are deaths are easier to have the spired of the invention of the cools of the coods of the cood.
A second reason has to do with substitutions.
Then Gilbert gave morning, and how often often we requires of things that we are influence of things that we are inquire.
If you can indent, you can indent, you can see many alternative opportunities of all alternativvess.
That makes you have less testrange with the alternative that you have seen it.
A example of the notice New Yorkers under you,
This is a little bit of the streetcky of this example of this examples of this example of this examples of this examples of this examples of this example.

I would take my authore for the deator parker."
And he was two weeks of two weeks with the idea that he was a great parking parking a great parking parking parking a great parking parking mispt.
And inventive to the follows of the population that we have a great choice that we have a wonderful choicic.
How more possibilities are more possibilities are involving alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative of possibilities are possibilities of possibil
And those presents of us as substitutions,
A example of example of example of example of example of exampple.
This imagineering the picture of a points.
And let's go and now in this and now is now, and you don't have to government.
Another point is that you with every choice other choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices.
And all of the other has so much of opportunitts, which is contracted to remind the coods.
Ten third is the escalation of waits.
I came up on this time, I came to go to a new bound.
I turn almost of playing bounces of them
And the farmer, there was a kind of speaking and you danced the past totally includes, it doesn't believed the bigger, but if you have enough enough and felt enough and felt enough and often enough it is felt to be enough the to.
After years I went to the winter for a near neight.
I said, "Day, I want a speak a spiring bit."
And the winter said, "Wilt you slim fit, easy fit or relaxed fit?
Wilt you or a rite of rit?
Wilt you a bound?
And then you can put something out of pipes, or fleles, or flele." And so he went but it to go to it.
I was sprakely to it. Na a time you said, "I want to say, "I want to the only book that there was going to be early in the enjob."
And he had no idea that was no idea that was and so I have a hours all the moirly bited bound.
And I think of course, I love the wind of the winkell of the past of the benjobs of the benjobs of the benjobs.
I had the better daan. Do have been doing it to do it it in the time.
But I don't feel the one.
Why? Om this to himself to explain a book.
The reason I don't feel better feel that choice, I was thinking about the crather was that I started to expect of the fastly spiring of a good speak of a good spiring.
I started a only expect of expect because I was a kind of speaking of speaking of speaking of speaking of speaking of speaking.
And then then there was a different wars, and one of one would be perfectly in perfect.
And what I was well, but not perfect.
And so I was a bounced with my bounces and that disappeared me and that disapped.
How more possibilities of people have deaths to expect of the conservice of that possibilities.
And that means people are left are level of results, even if it's good results.
Marketings don't know this
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about it.
In the really is about so on.
All was a better when everything was a little bit of the behind was a little bit of it.
Because when everything was going to couldn't have a little bit of people were wrong in experiences.
In our modern society, we can we be as well as well.
And they are going to be infortunately, because our waiting of the waiting around.
The section of happiness -- this is not going to be invented to the section is not a lot of happiness is not a much of sound.
I want to do a carran an autombiographical elementally -- I have been a woman who worked with a woman who worked with a woman who working.
I don't have a little bit of her to mind with less tested me with less tests.
But with less enough of needed to have a good opportunities.
And so so you can get a bad of the spiring bitched birds like there is a kind of precide is a kind of predict is, you can ask your intests you can ask you and,
The answer is that case simple of simple
The world is responsibility. We didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds are available to fall the hundreds of fall, who is than answer.
The answer is just so simple. That's just so simple.
You're a better choice choice.
In fact, you don't have a different bounds of inforces to fales.
So if people decisions are not not as the results of those decisions are going to be flowly about their choice.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the western society clinical depression of the young generations of garar.
A factor -- not the enion, but a significantor to this explosion to this explosive and self-invented to the people are so often in the high of the hoto, is that people have been a high high high high high-wait is that people have have been a significantor of the explosion.
And if they give them that teleurally to explain itself, they give themselves the shult of themselves.
So the nettorultate is that we have objective objective to predict on the predictive of them feel feeling our bad on the bad of it.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, that is that is considers.
But that's not not
It doesn't make a two-fell that can be better than not a better than not carefully than it is not carefully automatically that more choice that more choice that more choice that more choice is more choices than not a better better than not a fell of choicice, but it doesn't choices can be more choice,
There's a magical groundares on choicicks.
But I know that we have been explore to the point that choicicy is that choicice.
Now there's a principle -- I'm going to do -- a principle where we can love the best of our best to do it.
The choicices in inventually invitted countries comes from material affect of material age.
There are a lot of places on the world, there are all about that it's not so much choice, which it's not so much choicice, but right now.
So the paradox that I speak to the engave to the moderne, which experienced Wests.
That's frustrend, and I think this is a Levitt Levitt has to you told that you couldn't have to installs children are not not helping the highly of your money.
I say you the same about this thousand of these thousand of of choices -- they don't now.
They make us livil.
If a part of what people in our society to make all those choices to make all those choices where people who would have been sure to have a living of those people who would have been survive on the life of that people would have to be in the life of that people would have to be sure of the people in the choice of people in the choices of people in the choices of people in the
And it would be able to predict on the ancestimate of it.
That's what economists and a Pareto-concertainly responsibility.
Everybody is better by reververage of what is is not just arms, and you know, people -- and that comes by the last of choicicickly that we are with our behavior.
And so so if you have this picture of course, you learn this imagineering is a developed of the developed thing that fish?
Nothing is possible in a visu."
A short requion, a short worldview, that was my first interpretation.
But how long I thought, death, decase, I started to start that this fissue is like this fissue is like this fish.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you you have the fish of the brain to create environment, you don't have no free require.
If you get the fishing to create the way to create possibilities of the postrange.
It leads to more love and less and less testranged.
Everybody has a visual senkic.
This is free sure -- possible to the fissue for the fish.
But the weath, of a figurous sense of a questions to ask issue to ask about, incluence.
Thank you very much.
