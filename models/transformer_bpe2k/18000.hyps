Last year I showed these two dia's dia's pid-pool, which the pool, who had about the pool, who had about 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States, by 40 percent of the United was croms.
But this is actually the nest of this particular problem because it doesn't have the died of the ice.
The ice of ice on the North Pole, in a certain sense, in a clopping heart of our global climate system.
It's in the winter and crossing in the summer.
The next slia that I shows is a quick version of what the past 25 years.
The permanently of ice is dously,
As you see, it comes out to dark blue.
That's the anniversal ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called permanent, five years or parent, is almost like flower, is almost like flower, that from the body is soil.
In 25 years is the way of this to this catch this.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozen frozen frozen cks, and there is a very big amount of woman, and there's a very big amount of woman, when it was death, when it was death, when it was death,
Dike with the total amount of display in the atmosphere, that could be described that could be double to the crazy as we described the crossing point.
In some indeep depth of the Alaska board of far, in Alaska followed from the water.
And then the last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another ondie.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is the question is going to be that will be be well.
A reason for there, is that this huge mous warming Greenland from the north of the north of warms.
This is a melectwaterriver twaterriver two.
The water volume is echer than echer than eat.
This is the Kangerlussion.
If you want to know how the sea solid of the agricultural is the place where the place is the place where the sea place where the sea place where the sea place where the sea.
These stroming are flu.
On the other hand, on the other size, on the South Pole, is the largest ice mass on earth.
And the last month reported scientists scientists that the whole continent now,
More specific is the ice, in the lasts of the South Pole, very quickly in the edge of the meltings.
The whole continent to six feet seeing seemingly like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after largest ice mass, there are new now, that was a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets the help of his drinkwater of that melate.
In the Anthing, is this glestyle the source of drinkwater for this city.
There's more stroms.
But when they disappearing and then the drinkwater.
In California was a reduce of 40 percent in the snowping of the Sierra.
It comes terrible in the water reservoires.
And as you could read, the predictions are the predictions
This global dream of the worldwide, to a dramatic style of bos' fuels.
And the number of course, the number of course, is speaking with an incredible and never seen seen face and never seen set of fastness.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 tons every 24 hours.
25 mics ton every day in our oceans, Keat the eastern area of the Stille of the Stille of the Stille of the Indian subcontinent, there is a behaviors of Indian subcontinent, there is a test daling of the oceans.
The only big causes of warming warming, the next next to deforest deforest, which is the source of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of the Earth, is the sobed of a reforest of the Earth,
Oil is a problem, and stead, and steenching is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding with China.
And there was a proposed to build a lot more support carbon centrales.
But we see a circumultable.
These are the bombs carbon that the big-carbon in the last years, and where big-year-old engineered forget forget forged forgetting forward.
There's a political fight in the country.
The urban carbs, and oil industry gave form of 250 million dollars to promotion, which is a concept coal coal coal coal of cool.
And that picture of me thinking.
And the guy was there at me in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally bully.
You probably have seen it in the news of news.
This is the biggest of the largest disconclude in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the support cooles-coole-cooles.
Video: "Frosty the steay carbon man is a stage, up, a stage, chaged guy.
He's considered away here in America, and he care in America, and he care growing our economy.
Frosty the bone-carbon man is scree with the day.
He's paid and stiny and covered their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia foot of dapty.
The largest minside of the country is the big blay Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship is "Let me be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, don't know where they have to talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate,
This is a piece of a piece of a thing.
Video "Bue COLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat for our things.
That's why the reason is why the most important goal is to give a giant entering to the light to the light of the light and the regular of the truth of cities.
Fit is, coal is not smart.
We find that the shes is -- and it again.
So, you don't make worried about climate change
Let me show you that only about us.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shell.
Fantastic. The machines are making very little lay to do is a little lay.
But that's the sound of shone of shone cool.
Despecially the fact that the fit of stead, one of the most important warming of the most important warming of the Earth, the remarkable cooling cools that you see all here.
Look at the way argument is the shapes technology of today.
Al Gore: Einventually past the positive alternative to our economic challenges and the region the area of national safety.
Video: Imama, America wrong in crisis, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wirell all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel staff like vile collapsing and circulate oil.
But now there is a killed new solution to get out of this.
Fequivalent of 100 percent of shone electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to work on the work of work, a plan that safer and the operate of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth's returns out to the operate of the Earth's work.
And so that we have a solution that circutting enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Design.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Do is to give America to give America to give America
One of the fastest ways to make a end end of our dependence of old fuel straight sources that our planet, to help our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, and sun, a new energy system.
Man 2: No investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to become realistic
Al Gore: There's an old African parent, "If you want to be fast fast fast is all the time.
If you want to go far far with it.
We need to go far far far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So I am like this is the biggest of those who were not waren: The largest scientific experiment ever scientific experiment has ever been in the entertain blow-flowing end.
It must be the circumstances that were following less than a billidest second after the universe to 600 million times a second of 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, d!
This is the machine under Gene:
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one where I work. It's called ATLAS detector -- 44 meter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in attacular so you can see the scale.
At 10 september 10-year set of the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taking by ATLAS.
That causes a party of a partness.
It's a picture of the first particle straight that all the way from LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is bottest with a piece of the LHC, valvalue.
In other words, when we knew that picture on 10 September 110 September that works, what a huge over.
I don't know if this is the largest across this is the biggest of the Internet page and saw that the Internet page out of the Internet page of sag.
That means that we did a kind of cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact of a scientific impact that means we did a scientific impact of a scientific impact a cultural as a scientific
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what to do with these golden behaviors.
And those behaviors ago 13 thousand craise the machine on full force works.
The engineers will say, "Not true will say, "Do true.
They can do that because they can do that because they're superidented to very low-temperates.
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, that can reach the blowing of the flowing that flower.
And in one of the connections between nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive constructive in the LHC, was a constructive in the LHC, was a constructive of the constructive of the constructive of the constructive in the LHC, was a constructive constructive in the LHC, was a con
And it was a wire of a wire of it was electric resistance against that 13 thousand ample come.
This was the result.
This is more insheer if you realize that that the magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of them were going to be about 30 inches of inches over 30 inches of inches more than 20 tons of the magnets more than 20 tons of the magnets more than 20 tons of them are going to be more than 20 tons than 20 tons of them than 20 tons of them
We civil to do about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out out of it, what we did we did it.
We all requency.
Now, they're back to again.
Eind murban will be the LHC again.
We will take it again, and we expect to expect to expect it to figure out what the building is what the building is what the building of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe are building the building of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, these unhappiness to the debate again, the debate research of scientific research. It's easily to research
I think it's really hard to be so hard to be so hard to be further than the value of things like the LHC.
I showing the last words to the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I think, while the dead, during the values of his teachers are learning his teachers of the truth, "Nthing is so dangerous Farael was so dangerous for the progress of human mind to the progress of science that we have not have a new world of science that there are not a new world of the world that we are not a new new world in the world of the world in nature, and that are not a new new new new world in the world --
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to start to asking you back to your children at your children at your children at your children play.
And when you discovered how to graduate it to deal and consciousness, you were actually to learn to learn by the way, and hands of space and hands of space relations.
Rut, you know, insight, because with understanding of the world to understand from the world to understand it.
If an information is inspired by the nest of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with my advisur Pattion and my fishing Jeein Kalanthi -- what I started to asking me -- what we would use a computer -- what if we could use a computer that enters, instead of the clubs, inspired to a plate charge of information that we could do with a clayer information with a ply clay cross-ck information with with the information of information
and can ordering as we wanted to want to do that?
And these question was so fell we decided to go to see, by the building of Sifttables.
Cort cooperate is a Siftable to an interactive computer size of a cow-cooks.
They can be moved with the does, they can feel each other, they can felt detect and they decided to wireless and wireless to wireless and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands can be moved by flowing them by focusing on it.
And the fevendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that these aid resources are of physical differently, are aware of their movement, and even of the way we move and each other, there are different new and fun interactions.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is instead to tell a video to tell a video that playful, which is playful, and others and others playful.
These interactive portraits are conscious consciously.
Indians near next to each other place, they will interest to each other.
If they are cirircutttoo, they can also be making and what become a little bit of magnular.
And they feel movement, and copy.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequencing of these interaction, the use of all areas is, the use of a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid la fluid loud.
In this example of three Siftables emmers to be able to go to a color in a very very employed to go and use them to be amazing color in a very very front of the wheels of the example of these are mountaintables of these examples of all.
If we have over-driven -- we went back a little bit back.
There are some cooperation of possibilities for education, especially playing, mathematics and logics where we want to give people the ability to be able to see the ability to see the outcome, and the result to see the result of the way to see the result of people to see the ability to see the possibility of the way we want to see the ability to
Here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci by a simple calcular programative programatic --
Here we show a game that a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the running literally gets on every Siftable, and feed words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is very screamed to be very scue, and applies a new series of composed to the briages.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in it, and I am in it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these apping things that is needed instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Most word" and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people at the testing of the testing
That's our youngest biggest biggest bits.
And as it takes the Siftables lessing laught on the botttles.
And for him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning from language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstration.
He can bring new carakters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that character of the table,
Here he shows the sun.
Video: The zon comes up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene blowed blowed a tractor in the scene blot.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good dar! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttables and the needle of Sifttables and the needge of the characters with each other -- Video: Wa!
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a open end.
and he decided to destraight how it aasts.
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example I will show you to show Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed the recent of the lead, where every Sifttables a sound producing of the lead, bass and pressed the lead, bass and pressure present the lead,
Eengineering has four different variation, where you can choose what you want to use
These sounds can be injected in a very very injected to the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the death of a very very very log Siftable effects of a lot of available effects like reverb and filter.
They are being able to a sound of sound and access.
Further the general effects like tempo and volume that are advanced on the entire pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We start with a living in two Siftables, to a first patterns, to a first pattern, to a very first pattern.
Now, I really, the basline.
Video: Now, I'm feeing a little battles.
Video: And now I copy the movie to the movie for the effect of the effect of life.
Video: I can do it very quick by the offices by the offices of the tempo bloke.
Video: Now, I copy the movie to the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can recreate the pattern of the pattern as the playt.
So I don't need to plum, but I can improvise and improvise to the go.
And finally the dimming of the dims of the volume Siftable to left on the left.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion out of new people's computer interfaces that are better interfaces in the way our brain and body works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of cooking with some couple of possibilities that we develop developing in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the attack-in-in-generation of aid resources for the interacting with digital media, which is bring the information to our world as we wanted to do it.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you to all the time.
I'm writing.
But, my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life for a long time I was writing from writing and I don't think that ever will ever change that ever change.
And yeah, there is unfortune in my life and career and career care, I had to see my relationship with my work on my work to see my work to see my work to see my work on my work to see my work to be re-away.
It started with a book that I was written a memoire: "Ets, Beminners, Beminnera is very very in contrait to my first work, and an international existence.
And the consequences is that people have to pull me as if I did do do birth as if I did bate.
And the thing -- all of what --
People come to me and questions to me and questions "Don't you to do this succes?
Don't you couldn't be able to write your entire life will be a book of the authordinary work, where people will be writing for warm.
Don't you get to this?"
Erg dissemed -- you know?
Of course, that would be very very remember I remember in my back, I was a teenage, when I was a teenager, I was a teenath,
People said, "Don't you get succes?
Don't you get to deal for evidence, that you will be able to supposed by it?
Don't you get your life to this work that is going to be able to be a lot of front of your bitters, and that you will be strong with your bitters, and you will fals?"
Something in that stretation.
In the short comes to this questions on this novely is called "Ja"Ja."
Yes, I'm afraid for all these things that are enough to be enough that are enough to be enough.
All of the time to all,
But I'm also a lot of other things that are very much other things for everything.
For seeing for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time when the angst of where the angst of the from.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that someone eight is to be affected to their mention on earth to their mention on earth are set?
What is that there is so particular to create processes to make us to make the effects of the mind-estess of miness, something about others in the minds.
Take my father. He was clearly chemistratively engineer, and I can't remember that there in the 40 years he was working on him or he was a working on him or he was a bang for a front of him or he was not afraid to him that was following in the
And so of that, "John, how is it with your chemist?"
No, not became not about it.
To fair be: shif, emistrative engineers have been crossing the centuries of the centuries of the mal-mal-mal-depressive coholide.
Scheat, who have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers are also instable, other creative people have been pretty pretty instable.
Look at the grimmy deaths of the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many felt young boy, often by own stiered by own own stiered by own own stiered by own stiered by own stiered by own stiered by own own stiered by own stiered by own stiered by own stierves.
And even the those who don't have a self-murder, seem to be under their gave to be under their gave to be away.
In the last interview for his dead, Norman Mailer: "My every one of my books is a piece of mitself."
That's kind of what to say about your life work.
But of these kind of including things we don't look up.
We all heard of all the earlier, and have all accepted with my all accepted with my all acception.
The mind is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity with let and that a artistate and that a artistate at the same time,
So I want to ask everyone here today is to you with that idea is living now?
Do you know, OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think it's not a pretty fast number of thought.
I like the creature.
And also even dangerous.
I didn't like to see that this century is so good.
We can creative mind to live a lot better than to live in it.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be to live to that dark in the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of my mind, in my situation, in my situation, for me, in my situation, in my mind,
Seker seemed the fase where my career is now in my career is now
Go now, I am a young amper vehicles.
I can do maybe four decades to be a four decade.
Hoose is probably what I'm going to be more putting out with the outside world as the outside, as the work that was following out on that outside of the outside.
We are here with friends under each other, so I can be wrong with the biggest success of my greatest success.
Jemy, what a idea!
If you think of the things that you know in the morning, you know the morning,
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be able to work that I love the work I like to hold me.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time think, I am to the conclusion that I can just go to write with writing a psychological protection in the process in the process in the process in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of a psychological protection of a psychology ine.
I must be able to see a safe sears between mess, and my sure and my sure to understand very understanding of the reactions, and my sure publics.
I had been looking at the last year to ways to do that.
I'm in history of history and have done and have depply depply in other civilizations to see or others have been able to help people to help creative people to go to help the emotional complications of creative process.
My search has built me built me to the old Greeks and Romdying.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greies and Romestic and Romestic was not that creativity of themselvity of themselves,
Men believed that creativity was a god-de-party place, which was a following place, to the human fings and unknowledge reasons.
The Greeks called these Greeks called these crazy of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demon that he had a demon that words influist.
The Romenents had a species of equal idea.
And in them is a both of creative creative creative creative is a genious genie.
The funny is that the Romestic is not a particular piently,
In their policy was a genius of a magic god-de-party entities that were in the walls of the ateler of the artist.
A little bit like Dobs by the hul fr.
If the artistic was working on the work was removing assistance.
And it was the shape of the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the further about the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everyone knew how that in his work work.
The artists was so in protection to a lot of narcism.
If you was brilliant, you don't get all the eer.
Everyone knew that was an unvisible genius had taken to help
Whereat work on your work is crowed not just to you.
Everyone knew that you had a pretty undependent genion.
Lge time is that was considered how in the Wests creativity was consider.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed everything changed.
There is a very new idea: the individual human beings is the middle of the universe and state all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attention from the god-de-d-d-de-dd-de-dd-de-ddoring the godal --
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual lot.
And for the first time in history was about artists there was a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genion.
I must say I think I have to say a big front of a big front of the big front of me.
And to make one person, one person, one cell of individual human beings that he or she is whether it's essential, the source of the century of everything creative and the known forward to a very responsible for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask someone to set someone in sway.
Egos are read to gigantic proportion, and there are unfortune expectations of prestations of prestations of prestently copying.
And I think this drug has made a lot of artists a lot of artists killed a lot of artists.
If that is so on, and I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we return on a parent understanding of relationship between human beings and creative mysterious mysteri?
Maybe not.
We can do 500 years we can rational humanisn't undone in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes far.
And probably the way in the audiences people who are requipes about the idea that elerate decades of the idea that elfight that ell foot the work of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspired high-tems.
And it doesn't seem to get you all of that,
And I wouldn't ask me off.
Why not?
Why don't we have that thought is that though, right?
It is just so much as much awful as many of the totally calculated uncalculation that are uncalculating the uncalculation process.
Everyone that has to create something that is trying to create something -- so in fact, so all of the attacks, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process of the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to create something that is not always rationally to create about rate.
And that it is almost paranormy.
I have unfellow the great American closer to Ruth Stone is dicheat.
They are the purpose of the nee-genty. Her whole life already writing them.
She told me about her childhood on the plattle-and-foot of Virginia.
Some people like the field of the work was felt on the work was felt to a fight and over the country.
And it was so fellow a big wave air, air came air came air came air
And so close to go into the country to her across the country to her act.
She felt that the ground, under her food, and knew that moment and knew her at that time to do the time for her life.
She ran home, eight, and she had to see the paper than so quickly as possible and paper paper and paper to see paper and paper to see paper than so quickly to get as fast as fast as fast as well.
And when the poem came through her ha waves her ha was that her only chance to write it on the way to write it.
Sometimes she didn't quickly enough.
Then ring and ring six, but crossing the house.
And at the points of the poem of her him, seek about the field, seek -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poet.
And I think there were a lot of them -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost and, they almost of the fat.
And then she was looking for house and paper and paper the paper, and shes the paper and shes the paper and shaped by her him.
Juistist at that moment she had a potle-too.
And with her other hand, so she told me shaped to the fat.
She was poems, and she was poem it back into her body, while she wrote the way.
And in that case, the poem which was very close to my paper on paper, but in the entirely followed followed followed followed followed follow in the sense of the paper, but in the falles.
And when I was thinking -- what I thought is a bunch of the creative proces!
And this is how my creative proces! I'm not a medium! I am not a medium!
I'm a mouth, who every day on the same time on the same time of the same time and then flower, and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and transflowed by blood, and transport.
But even in that daily had a such of a such of experience.
You will also know the feeling of the feeling of creative ideas in your exciting from a source of a source of a source of a source of a source of the source of a source of the source of a source of the ideas in your exciting in your exciting from a source of the way you can identify as you can identif
What is that it for bron?
How can we use it without that we become that without a lot of this?
At a way that is good for us to do that?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician's musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazing.
We had this.
Tom is a big part of his life is a big part of his life was showing the crowed of the crazy artists that come out of all the power of the impulsable creative impulsable creative impulses in him to impulsable creative impulsable impulses in him.
And the years of Tom was a little bit more rough.
And one day he was reach in Los Angeles about the fast and change the process of radical.
And as he was so served there he heard a fragment,
The decided to him, like inspiration that is a crowling bable, crowling bable.
It was a nice melose and he wanted to fashion.
But it didn't go to that.
He didn't had no paper touch, no paper at a table to see a taneously in it.
The well-known exciting back to the melically, "I got the melice, and then stay and then stay to me evening the century behind me event.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it right, I can't be it."
He didn't get a birth of panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry heard, you can't see that I have to be behind the piece?"
"Do you really writing that I can write a song,
If you really want to get this songe, you have to pull later when I have time for you.
Don't be a different so.
Go neighborhood at Leonar, and from that moment when the time the process of the process of process.
And the work itself, the work is the same thing with the dark subject.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him resed, when he distance distance of the geniius of the geniius of geniiious
The geniy set it on the skin and livers it only calling up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go to it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the odd aspect that not completely of Tom itself.
And that story my way of working changed to work in the way of work
I had been profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddden Bidd: Beminning.
And at a point moment I felt in despair in despase.
You know that what you want to do is not a good thing and you think it's a terrible ramp of the bad book. The bad book.
not just just bad bad and really really bad to bad it.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project all of the project
And then I remember, I remember, and I decided to be a potent.
I was going to go from my manucrip, and founded me to a very very focused of the room.
And I said, "Lister then, we know all of the way that if this is not just like this book not just brilliant -- not only by me.
You can see that I have to see everything I have in my thing.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you think it's better than you have to do anymore, you have to do your things.
Do you don't have to do that, you ammer not, right?
I just write because that's a bad because that's a bultoo.
Oh, and in the notabuland make it is a lot of dealing with cancer today is a different."
Tja--- Using the right right now.
Eeut, there were in the North African desert people together to dance in month, to thth, to thank you in the next music.
Uren and hours, to the morning, to the morning.
That was always amazing, because the dancers were folded professionals.
But sometimes happened to be something for a behind something for summers.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you know what I mean, you ever ever seen a though thing to a performer.
It was like the time was stilling and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights in the thousands of night, but now everything together.
And suddenly he didn't have a human beings just a human beings a human beings
In him, under him blowed him blowed him blowed him blowed him blowed him blowed him blow.
A godnment,
If something called the thing happened was happening to claps, people what it was Dan eig, and the claps, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because it was for them.
And by the way, a nice of historical fact, when Moren South Spange, Spange, they brought this use, they brought this usually including with them.
The intest is echer by the centuries of the centuries of "Allah."
And that you hear today to be the day at today in the flaments and flaments and flads.
If an artists in Spanish something impossible or magically, or magically, "Allah, oh, great, oh great, Allah, great, Allah, great, b."
As understanding of God.
Precions we need to have what we need to have what we need to do.
Lasty is the dance is that the next morning, the next morning, he was discovered that he was a following 11 hours in the morning.
And at that moment he is a little parents of anceing with bad of cooperate to such a more to such high.
Maybe there will never be a little bit of a little bit of time.
What do he has to do is that rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to selling a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be not to be to.
Imagine that you don't know about it is the most unusual aspects of your person from your person from you.
Imagine you believe that you have a while you have a while to specifying a while to be able to specific bron.
And when you ready it, they are given to someone else.
And so it is how to be everything.
I high inevent average to do it.
The last months I have worked on a book that will be short. The book will different. The book where a lot of too long to go to the soil.
The operating of that illuster progress progress progress progress progress of the illuster progress of the illuster progress of the illuster progress progress progress progress progress progress.
If my mind thoughts with me to the hall, I like the same and, I don't know the same and, I don't know it.
Do just you work.
And just you do thing to do is, what it is.
If you are task your job is to dance you, thank you very much.
If the godnment genius is access to decide in your work at some time in your work on some time of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful sourcing "Olone!"
Don't be that thank you in the dance than it is.
And then, "Olen!"
I believe that I believe that I believe
"Olen!"Well, how to do it because we are pure human love and propertly, it's just by flowing plum.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olen!
You know, I had been talking about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that can meaning new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology to the digitize and now we're trying to go from those digital code to a new fase in the new fase in the design and synthetthesis of the digital code of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think about a lot of biologists have tried to understand in different levels.
We tried to have different approaches to left back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years, it's 20 years.
And when we have the human genome of genome that was set out of the analoge world of the analoge of the engineer world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask question: can we live new, or we can create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a kind of that can conclude itself, in a laboratory of a laboratory of a laboratory of a laborator.
And we have tried to look at whether we can come to a nature smaller.
We can go to the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or both both of the 500 or both that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map of map, is that relatively amazing with the one.
Geloof me, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes that we can check a piece of ceasy that this was very unliving cell to be a living cell cell to be a living cell.
And we decided to do that, the only route forward to synthetism this chromosome to synthetise so we could deal the components to be so the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started a chromosome chromosome synthetthetis?
Stage the chemistry to make these very big molecules that we never have before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome chromosome of "restart?
A chromosome is a chromosome of chemically, a piece of chemical.
So, our tempo of digitize of digitize of life is across exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code of rather slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly acting the gently.
And our last point to this moment on this moment on this point,
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some couple of stage for a bio-ethical ethical ethical acction to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length of DNA degeneration process, so how longer you make more fout.
So we had to have a new method to make a new method of these little pieces and corrigate of all the front of all the front of all the front of these little pieces of all the front of these little pieces of little pieces of these little pieces and corrigerate of all the fites.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria tiny frequency.
We designed the pieces, the pieces, the front of the outcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of chemical chemical stant chemical stunks, and the bacteria genetic code of the genetions and virtues, and virtues, and virtually make a chemically,
The viral particles were going to be able to local cells, they came back and deaths back and deaths the E. coli. coli.
I was unfortune with the oil industry, and I said to do that model but I said that model but all to well.
They laughing more than you.
So we think this is a situation that this is a situation where the software are building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something a lot of bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of chromosome of it.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes, so we could various in cassettta settta settta --
to understand what the deal components of a living cell.
The design is critical is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very accut.
When we first did this genome for the first time in 1995 was the standard exactly a front of one mistake a 10,000 based.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 founds. If we were used to get the original sequence, it was not in the way to start starting to start to start to start in the way.
And part of the design of design is the design of pieces that 50 letters are affecting 50 letters to all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so-un-on-to-un-on-to-un-under sub-to-of design so they can go together to go together to design so that they can go together
We design here unique parts in the way to design in it.
Maybe you might have affected waters.
Beventually, we have a four-literal code: A, C, G, Go and T.
Trios of those cos for rubs for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a very one-inoxyouous.
So we can use the genetic code to write, sense of words, thought.
And in fact, we just just a lot of it.
Some of them were felt that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of studying that we can eat them with answers.
There are enzymes they repair and together and put together.
And we started to start to make pieces of these pieces of five to 7,000 letters were able to 7,000 letters long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 7,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every city of city that we could have a flower, so we could sequences them because we could sequencing a process that very robust, is that very robust, is -- that will be very robustraight -- that will be sequences to see the straight -- that will we see them sequences to sequences them are sequencing a process of these pieces that we could sequencing a proc
We try to get the point of automatiseration.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as we come to come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 based, they don't grow so easily more in E. coli. coli.
That is the expensive of all molecular biology.
So we went to reach with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-od-od-a-combined repair of biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair of the clays.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million radiodurans that three million radiation of radiation to can.
And that you see in the top panel, soil, shem cromosome of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he was a little bit again.
There are thousands of organisms that around.
These organisms can be completely cheat.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there is life in space, that can profesh promotion, a new aquatic environment.
NASA has a lot of the way, there is a lot of it,
Here's a very deal microp-photograph of the molecule that we have created with these processes -- fact with these processes with the right design of the pieces that we did in the right design of the pieces that we did them.
And then you know, it is that they add automatically food.
This is not electron-microscope photo; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope of light
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audience, we exploded ungs.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-points letter, without a 10-points of a 142 pages -- to press the genetic code of genetic code down.
Now, how do we started a chromosome? How do we started to do it?
And a virus is it clearly easy is very easy.
And a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, like that, you whose the cell of the cell of the cell and do a other in, and that's what you know as the clones.
And in the bacteria species of chromosome of integrated in the cell, but we have a full of transpline that we can see a full transplant of a chromosome of a cell to another other, and it can be a different and it can be a different and activate the actives.
We have a chromosome of a chromosome of a micro-side.
These are about so far as far as people and mics.
We added some extra genes so that we could select for chromosome select of chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome for this chromosome for this chromosome of chromosome of this chromosome of extra chromosome of this chromosome extra chromosome extra chromosome extra chromosome of this chromosome of extra chromosome of what extra chromo
We have the required with enzymes to make all the equivalent to make all the equipment.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in cell -- and you will be very available images here -- the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to solid to solid to develop the process of what was going to be developed to develop the process of what we thought was going to be able to develop the process what was further to be further to so.
This is an essential evolutiontion,
We found all discovered all kinds of these kinds of chromosome or a third chromosome of it, or a third of thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People that evolution evolved, as if there is one to be a lot of biology not have a lot of biology for a lot of biology
There are enzymes that restricti-zymes are enzymes that are really engineering DNA device.
The chromosome that in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome in it, we stop in it.
It was express the other chromosome of chromosome as a strange of material, and so forth of material, and so we had the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of material, and it was a strange of a birirth of material,
He was blue from the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in very short time amazing of all the characteristics of the end, and change the whole species of based on the new software that we in the cell software that we in the cell in the cell of the cell of the cell of the new software that we stop in the cell of the new software that we in the celling of the cell of the new software that we stop in the new software that we stop in the celling of the new spec
All protein changed, the membranes change -- when we were the genetic code -- the exactly where it was changed.
This is what we are clinks like genomics of chemist, but we are in the process of the software DNA, to change things fundament.
Good, I paid for a little bit of a further -- this is the front of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid a new version of years of evolution, and I paid a new version of the Cambranches where there are big new species of scale, new species of these digital design species of new species of these digital design design species of this digital design species of this digital design is to this digital new species.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly when you look at what it is.
We're going to go in the next 40 years, during the next 40 years, during the next 40 years.
To place, in my context in my context in 19466.
There's three people on this planet.
for every one of us who lived in 19466; within 40 years, that there are four
We have to have food with food, with the concerned water medicine, medicine, medicine, fuel for the six-half billion.
That's really really really really really to do that for notice.
We use five billion colies, more than 30 billion coly, more than 30 billion oil.
That's 100 miloons of flowers a day.
And when we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than to replace; then that's going to be a huge challenge; then that's going to be a huge challenges.
And of course, of course, of course, all these carbon dioxide of the atmosphere.
And by all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dead different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is prevented out of this.
We are precise by a biological reality and our example,
We now have techniques of technique synthesemethods to do so-called combination genomics called combination genomics
We now have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the transfer of 20 million different genes or tries to make processes to make octan octon to create octape or medicine, new vaccins, we can change with a small team of the molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can select for life-fatbalthy, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen imagination of what real design design is where we work to work on the gang and a new kind of design kind of a new kind of design kind of a new kind of design kind of computer can design in computer designs.
We don't know about how it will see out of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of sics.
We are now fourth of fourth generation fuel stones.
And the floors have seen following to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuel that will come out from sugar, to more high high high high and more high and a different kinds of butano.
But the only way we think that biology big influence is a big food nextility and the death, and the describing is as we start acting with CO2 as his food and so we are now now now now now now to design the first of doing it in that way to do the first of them in that way we think we think we know the first fourth generation of a 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries discoveries are all other methods.
This is an organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the depth of a 2.5 miles followed temperates.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water star water strainy source of molecular hydrogen
We are looking at whether we can take CO2 and we can be able to be able to follow through pipes to follow to follow this process, where the CO2 fuel to burned, to stop this process.
So in a short erage, we think we are able to think we're able to bread, "What is living to the basal question: "What is life?"
We have realize you know -- the availables, the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED -- where you can do this?
A important power is becoming an important power.
But we're also now now now now using these tools to think about fastly servaccines in cines of cine.
This year there was the gricultural flow, we always have a little bit of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that change that can change by the teaching vaccines of the forward to make it by creating vaccine.
Here you see how the future can go through it, it will be changing the evolutiontion, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and finally finally eventually eukaryota.
We are still farmers far away of people.
And our goal is certainly to be able to survive to survive to survive to do that maybe you can do that maybe you can do that maybe you can do that.
What I want to show you as a little bit of a new technology that we have to see in a new technology that we at at a very very year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment where you can local local or on the distance of fishing data.
We look at many gigabies here in digital images and can be able to do this narross and exactly exaccess, and except the sorters and the sorters to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at how big these collections or images.
Most of them are normal camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of the 300 meapixel of the 300 meapixel of the 300 meapixel of the Librans,
It all does nothing because the only thing that would be affected to be affected to a such a system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-picture data.
This is the graue house is by Dickens. Ela column.
And to prove that it is really text, and not a imagination, and not not a imagination, we can do something like this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bird way to read a e-book way to read.
I wouldn't be adapted it.
This is a realistic, this is a example of The Guardian.
Every big image image is the beginning of a bottom.
This is really the pleasure of a real paper and the experience of a real papers or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium of medium --
We also have done something with the corner of this except of The Guardian.
We have a nep advertention of high resolution -- a lot of higger than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the ability of this car seat, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really do for sure that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen of the screen at the screen of the screen.
We don't hope that this is not pop-ups more means and other suddenly flaws.
Of course are amaps a for the hand is a lot of acpassions for a technology like the, I will not spending to this time to this field, except that we can also be a lot of a lot of additions.
These are all the away in the U.S.
on top of a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else to something else.
This is now now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who two techniques of each other techniques with each other techniques with each other techniques with each other techniques with each other things.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision research by Noah Snavely, promoso on the University of Washington, ago by Steve Seitz at University on U.World C.
and Rick Sriski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's meant possible by Seadragon.
And when we do this, you see that we can see by the images and the multi-resolution of the images.
The space that the case of the images.
The computer vision of the computer vision algorithms, so that they are craching the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they're genomomes -- where they're genomomes of stabilizized diashows, and all these things are space.
I don't know if there is a time or there is other environments.
There are a lot of space phone are more space televisier.
I want to like to be one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynthesip, to the communicate what I in my head is the reality -- to the environments to see the environments to look at the environments to our website.
We had to do reaccountable:
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and campus and campus and campus and the campus and campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the Notre Dame of the Notre Dame of the Notre Dame of the Notre Dame of the things from Flickr.
And every one of these orange chirs of chirds that are part of this model of this model was a picture of this model of this model of this model was going to be part of this model again.
And so all these Flickr imagine, which are all copy in this way of copy in this way of copy in this way of copy.
And we can took at simple evidence.
You know, I had never thought I would never work.
It's overwhelmed to be so unclear.
I believe you can see that this is many types of cameras are to mirror to mirror reflexcameras, a big number of it,
I'll try to find out what strange images.
There are so many of them are so much by faces and so on.
Erwhere between this is even a series of photographs --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is cheap, by the program.
If we have four through the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data -- from the whole data -- from the entive memory -- and the Earth looks like this.
All these pictures are getting together with each other and shapes a very little bigger than the som of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth's entire Earth's entire Earth's entire Earth's entire Earth's entire Earth.
As a consequences like a Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use the use, and the most of the people who use it.
Their own photographs are previous data that someone else inved.
If someone all these heigs would like to climb and their names and their names of the Notre Dame is racting with all of those data, and I can use as a access to the space, and I can use as a access to the space, and creature created with this kind of cross a kind of cro-modale, and created social experience.
And of course, the be-product of this imments rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who not only was air photos, satelious images and other access, satelipes and other access, but also from the collective sections.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what you know is possible to do is possible on a day, in the next years, all of the images that are dealed by everyone in the next years, all the images that can copy the world can copy?
BA: Yes. What this really does this really do is discovered.
It creates, to your wiss, hyperlinks between imagines.
And it does that based on the data in the imaginations.
And that's being a set exciting when you think of the wealth of semantic information that is described in the wealth of these imagines.
And when you look for imagine, you feel a search of a search of the webbpage and the texty, far information about what the image is the image of information about what the image is the image.
What if you copy is that picture?
And then the number of underling semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of there,
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasures of evening eventually is the ability to life between the old living between them who are not forget to life between them who are still in the wind, the ancient stomes, the attacks, the attacks, the profitting bitters.
The science that Jay is still to the Malaxy is still the Malaxy of the galaxy of Inchest, or that the mythes of the Himalaya boodhists still to do the air at the ama, remembers of Dma, reminds you really don't really think that the world that we don't live in a solutely life in a coupology, but the world is not a few model of the engineer is not a model of the circulcult of the work,
the consequence of a straight set apply choices that our ancestors are generations adapted our ancestors of generations ago.
Of course, we all share all the same adapted to the same adapted born. Breng children in the world.
We all make all insrites are all the inform of things.
And the including of the inverbly dishem by the box.
So it can't be surprising that we all all singing, dancing and art.
But interesting is the unique of the song, and the ritm of the dance of the dance in every different culture.

They all learn that we can think different, different different from us to the earth of the earth of them.
If you think about it, you can just give you a lot of them feature.
Samen forms the intelligentor of the world is a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her just as important as the biological life: the biospiritual life web: the biospiritual life.
This cultural life web is cultural life is a front of the front of the front of it.

And then, the most optimic scenario scenario of scenario of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing of this.
And then everyone here was born born there, there were six-thousand of languages.
A language is more than her words or her gramatic rules.
A language is a free of human sice.
It's the vehicle that is the sick of every unital culture the material world.
Every language, is a century part, a crowd, a shift, a mind, an ecosystem to spiritual potential abilities.
And from that six-thousand of talks today is the day the day of that not more in children in the children in the mind of fluist.
They don't become babies to be longer adapted babies
Effectively means that, unless a change change that they are dead.

And then recipe that is somewhere in the way to be astrong every two weeks to the earth because every two weeks of them in the earth, and the starting to him in the last letter of an old language.

And finally, I think it's clearly to this high at this high to these homa of the world is resed, that they actually don't far away from the world --
They are somebody's home country.
They are following of human imagination, which are going to go back to the beginning of time. And for us all the time. And for us all the dreams of these kids, just like the unflowers, as that are the dreams of a lot of hope.

where all the wisdom of all the way to us is being sading.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question of what I have been involved a book of what I have evidence.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
And I try to explain some connected to explain that you might have a little biti.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be, the official dogma of all the axy, industrialized society.
And that official dogma air line as a follow-to-ma-levels of our citizens on the highest level, we need to get them as much as possible as much as possible to them.
Freedom is immers a big cheap, an essential part of the human being.
And the flowers freedom is to acting to treat the own insight, to reach a higher which is prosperating a without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices like people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically means of what map.
This is so deep getting in our society that nobody would be on it.
And in our life is this dogma step of four.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. It's a tool.
Even about dressing things.
Narly that 175 size size class are threats in my supermarket crossing phoile virgin oil and twal-phoils and twal-piled balas a pully.
And then you can make task your task of your task for the case between 175 species for you.
So that's the contemporary of my supermarket.
Look at electronics wins. You can make your strong conclud-coset -- luid-cassetttess, cassetttesper, radio, astrong.
And that one electronics winke, you can choose your choose from this number of this number of disconteming out of this number.
You can be six-half million different systems, with with parts of these story.
Geat at -- you have a lot of chicians.
At another example -- communication.
When I was young ago you could all all kinds of phone phone of the phone -- but only at Ma Bell.
You don't hurt it. You don't bought it.
And that was the way to be the way to be able to go up.
And that time is fore."
And the way that are very many different across a lot of different across of different across it.
And in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cellphones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-player, neusamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamama
And the way you don't have this model that model in the winks, but you can certain of his define that that's happening to happen to be able to be that that's happening to be in the winks.
The sequenc: people come to the winkle and stelling this question.
And you know how the answer to that question aff?
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobly buying that doesn't do too much to do it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the attacks, is this explosive is this explosive is a fact of choices a fact.
Gealal-health care, it's in the United States, not so that you go to the doctor and that you have to do what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor and they said, "We can do A thing, or we can do But, or we can do Bay
As has this front of this and,
But, and naddling this and, what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is find out is what like this?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front, and But, and But, and But, and nads.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was what would you do you do that?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call "own invent of patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision of decide of the dead of things -- the doctor -- the doctor -- to a life's dead seases, and not the best condition to take decision to take decision to take decisions, and not the best condition to take decisions,
Good described that ners, because the goal group, because the goal group, you can buy them.
Why do do do we do not copy to buy them.
Because they think that we think we are the next morning, to ask the next morning, to ask that other notice measure is geneess.
Our identy, yet, right, a inguism of us are now overnance on choices, as you can see on this dia.
Our identity is above of our background.
We are invitself, so often we wanted to do but want.
Everybody morning, you have to think about what to person you want to think about what to person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the sin.
There's a time that freedomatically that freedom everyone else that you possibly possible to fast as quickly as possible to kids as well.
The only reality was choice with why, not when and what you did was a bad of it.
Now, free everything for the opportunity to it.
I left to be intelligent students, which I have double to less house work on than well-work than well-work.
They are not dommer or affected in early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Do I says, whether not?
Or will I wait? Do I first kids, or a care?"
These are all suspendent questions.
They go through to them through an answer, as this means they don't get all their househomework and that doesn't get a good cates.
And they have equ. It's important life questions.
And then we come to work with work. Carl gave just already that technology to work every minute every minute of every day -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, which is one place, which I love secret me like WiFi it does.
I don't like that, because I want to hold that place for mists.
But good, that huge choice, that tremendous choice, in that we are more and asking us to the questions, or we're going to work, or we are now, or not.
We can look at a footbalaxy, we can look at our son, with us with us the one change, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and the Blacks.
And even if they all fight from the way to the past minute of those meath, with all kinds of questions, "Am I think this phone answer?
As I write this emailtl? Do I writing this letter?"
And even if the answer, we experience the football of our son a very different way.
And what we look at the big, the small, materialistic things, life styl: life is a kickishing choose of choose of choose of choose of choose choose of choose choose of choose --
And so the world looked like the world there was earlier.
There were a little choices, but not everything was a question.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this well?
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what is good about is a good thing about is what is bad to talk about what is bad to it.
That huge choices has two effects, two effects on the human beings on the human beings on the human beings on the human beings on the human beings on the human beings on the human beings on the human beings.
A very contradiction, is that it more lamming than contained than free than free than free of the free of the free of the freedom.
And so many choices people find the laster to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of that, a research of investment in free-investment plans.
A colleague, I got to investment in front of Vanguard, a big policy, a big policy society with about one million employees about 2,000 found.
They found that for every deal of every deal of progress foundaries that worked far away the work-far performance.
As fifth founds. Why did there 10 percent of less employees in five than at five than at five than five --
Because it is the foundly foundly so disconnected to choose that people are just choices to the next day, and that that I think, and that I think, and so on.
And of the extincluding out.
That means not only that people after their pensionate after their pensionate, because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to have been asked so lay so disconnected to have the choice that the choice was a very slightly for them to have create it.
And they were going to have to be 5,000 dollars a year to their nose.
The worked about, which is willing to reduce their own behavior.
So too many choices can be lamming to work
And I think the world is that the world looks like this.
If it is to the century the century of the century to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be operate with the wrong found, or even the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second thing is that we had the lost of us and choose the lost of us and choose eat, finally less entertained by the outcome, when we had less opties had been less opties of opties had been having opting.
There are further than to feel like to feet.
One of them is that there is that there was a choice, for example, follow-block -- it seems to be perfect.
You can be able to such a case that a different choice for that a different choice for that one other choice for that a other choice for that a other choice for that a different choice for that a other choice better choice.
This dream of alternative cars to get it to you get your choice.
And so, follow away to the follow of choice that you have made you have done you have made a good choice.
How more option, the more option, it's easier to have a foot of unfoot that election of the consuming options.
Second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave tomorrow of how often we depend the value of things that we are conditioning them.
If you can intend to intent, you can intent, you see a lot of fast changes of all the alternatives that you avoid that you were determines you
That makes you fewer to the alternative that you have choose it.
A example. For example, the non-year Jull: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the streck of this example.
This is stel in the Hamptons.
They have a third wound.
They are a wonderful strand. Straling weather. No human beings.
Do can't be right? "Do you don't think, "Do is the audy."
Everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city
I could do my car for the door, for the door."
And he is two weeks, with the idea that he was a great parking place, with a great parking place.
And substitutional cost of the entirely that we have from our choice, even if we have a great choice.
How more possibilities are possibilities there are more accessible alternatives.
And those presenting us as substitutional costs.
And this is an example of example.
This imagination is what took is a number of points.
Life here and now for example, and you don't have to contemporary things.
And one point is that you with every choice other choices of choice.
And all of that other has so amazing optional cants, which is the flowers to be fellow up.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in my square to a new bombs.
I turned out to be almost of them is always fellow up.
Beer there was only one kind of stuff, and you know, the bought totally not, the padest totally unbelievably uncomfortable to be uncomfortable to be agreed enhouse and often enough waste, felt the town.
And then I went to the winket for a new.
I said, "Da, I want to do a stuff, this is my me."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit is fit right?
Do you whether a rhys? Wilt you were stone-washed or acid-ward?
Do you have a brock with slip?
Wilt you something explaining pipes, or flu, or flut." And so he went through this.
I was a spraison it. After a while, I want to say, "I want to the only book that earli."
He didn't have no idea which was that was a hour for a hour for a hour, all the possible bly briages to fit up.
And I just just really, I excited the winks, I ended up with a challenged brock.
I had done better than I could do it better as possibilities I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Om Om this to myself, I wrote a book in a book of a book of a book of a book in a book of it.
The reason I don't feel better, I didn't feel better; I was a more began to expect of a good speed-stink of a good jobs of a good job.
I started without any any expectancy because I just just just a kind of stuff.
And then there was different ware, and one of them would be perfect.
What I bought was a good thing, but not perfect.
So I removed my brock with my bomban with my expectations, and that asked me teleging.
How more possibilities people have to have more expectations they coasting about the amazing of those possibilities.
And that means that people are less frandom with results, even if the good results, even though the results are good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case you don't know where I'm talking about that.
And in the really is about that.
Everything was bad to the bad was bad to the bad was bad to the lesson was bad to the lesson was bad to the lesson was bad to the lesson was bad better.
Because when everything was bad was bad people could have a little bit of surprising experiencing experience.
In our modern society that we can can we as well-variety citizens of the best thing we could ever be able to do is something so good as good as well.
Nonce we ever took not surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, torentirely to be high.
The secret of happiness -- this is all the secret is not to far -- the secret is not too much to be too much of happiness.
I want to do do is a car biographic elementally -- I was a folding that I was a woman who is really fantastic.
I didn't have a little bit of her not with less frankly.
But with less enough of mind,
And so, when you get a bad bad on the bad bad bad bad as there is only one kind of prefer -- you can ask your deaths why you are unteaching why you are unteaching why you are unteaching why you are unteaching a bad of the foot of the
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible to you have no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different blows, and you buy a turns out to fall, who's is than responsibilit?
The answer is just so simple. That's just so simple.
You had a better choice,
People hundreds of different bounds.
So if people decided to decide, even if the results of those decisions, are they good dealing about their choice.
And they take itself, they take itself.
In the western society is clinical depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of
A factor -- not the enial, but a significant factor in this explosive too summers of depression and self-suicide experience of their high expectances of their high expectancy founds.
And when they try to explain the teleuration for itself, they give himself, they give himself.
So the netoraded is that we fellow objectively is that we fellow us to feel it.
And just a collaborate to a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everyone is that by everyone is the way to everybody.
But that's not not the way it is not
It doesn't take a two-fellow that can choose better than not choose to choose feet of automatically that more choice,
There's a magic fluencence, I don't know about choice. Which is I don't know
But I know that we are already for a long time for a long time that choices are well-to-behavior.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best thing to keep the best of the best thing to keep the best of the best to it.
The choices in industrialized countries come out of material overflowed from material overflowed from material overflowed in the choice.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard about where the problem is not so much choice, but right now, but right now, but right now, it's a little choice.
So the paradox that I speak here with the moderne, so that moderne, which is the varding West.
That's frustrers, and this is frustrating, and this is told you that expensive and installing the same thing is to installing kids are not helping your money.
I say the same about this past choices -- they don't help -- they don't help -- they don't help the found: they focus to do it.
They are less value.
If a part of what people in our society is able to make all those choices to make all those choices of the choices of people have to do it.
And if we live in the way to go forward.
That's what economists is what economists is called a Pareto-a-a-concerned botttom.
Everyone is better by reverse of the reverse of what maps -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the choices that we are with us.
And so you think of this imagine, if you live in the sculp, you know, as a developed human being: "Ach, what know?
Nthing is possible in a fish."
A scale example, a shortile worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think, about it, I think about it, I understood that this fishing is the same smart of the fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you fish the fishing to create possibilities, you don't have a freedom, but amazing to create the crazy.
If you get the fishing to create possibilities, you get less of the abilities, you get less too.
It leads to more lose and less frequirement.
Everyone has a fish.
This is free to constently -- possible even for the fishing for us.
But the desire of a figures of a figure-flecting wells, devided unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
