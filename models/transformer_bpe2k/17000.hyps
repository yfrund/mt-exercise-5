Last year I showed these two dia's to show that the pool, which the pool, who had the pool, who had about the last three million years of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States.
But this is actually the nice of this specific problem because it doesn't show the didnâ€™t see the ice.
The ice of ice on the North Pole, in a certain sense, in a sense of our global climate system.
It turns out in the winter and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summit.
The next slide I show is a quick of what happened to see is a desperal of what happened to be happened by the last 25 years.
The permanently permanently in red.
As you see it out of dark blue.
That's the year ice of the year,
And the crimpt in the summer
The so-called permanent, five years of old, five years or parent, that is almost like flowing that from the body is takes of the body is there.
In 25 years is it from this to this go.
And that's a problem because the free-frozen frozen around the North Icszea, and there are a very big amount of carbon and there is a very big amount of carbon dead, when it death, when it dedeath, is demicrorom,
And the Until with the total amount of definitely conceived that that would be able to describe that that could be describing the amount of the enduring point to write the engineering point.
In some indeep indeep murn in Alaska board of the water.
And last winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another team to another ondiep diep diep more.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is the question of the one.
A reason for that is that this huge called warmtebron" Greenland from the north of the north of warms.
This is a melectwaterriver twaterriver twaterror.
The waterle volume is echer bigger than echer eat.
This is the Kangerlussian astra-Greenland.
If you want to know how to do the sea because the sea because the landips, it is the place where it is the place where it is the place where it in the sea.
These stromings are taking the chair devices are flu.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the last month month scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice of ice ice is that the whole continent to be a negative ice tremendous about the entire consciousness.
More specific is the ice, the ice of South Pole, very quickly in the South Pole, with some of underwater-water-a-eil-underwaters.
The whole continent to six meter sease, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after the largest ice massas, which a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the half of his drein-water of that melse.
In the Andes, this glestyle the bron of water for this city.
There are now more stroms.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California was a farmer-of 40 percent in the snowpak of the Sierra.
It comes in the waterreservoices reservoics.
And as you could read his dealing to be the predictions are going to be able to reach it.
This global dreaming of droogging to a dramatical trial styers.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen single speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at it from a historical context of a historic context of what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 ton CO2 a.m.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Keat the equired Stile of the Stille of the Stille of the Stille of India, and each side, and every single of Indian subcontinent, there is a three-stic daling in the oceans.
The only big cause of the earth of warming hearing the earth, which is 20 percent of money, it's burning about 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and stepped the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extensive with China.
And there was a predict to build a lot more city-carbon centrales to build a lot more citys.
But we see a commace of the engineer.
These are the coal-carbon which the bital became annuated in the last years, and where big-year-old alternatives were annuated forward.
There's a political streeding a political streeding in our country.
The cottool, and oil industire industire of 250 million dollars to promote "shifts of coal of promots, which is a concept of the concept of the concept of the coal of coal --
And that picture of me thinking about something like something like that.
And the guy was in Tennessee, at me in Tennessee, about four billion litereral comurban carbon mod.
You probably see it probably in the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news in the news of the news of the news of the news
This is the one after one after one after one after the America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the city's support sound the Kerst.
Video: ""Frosty the voice, a stay behind guy is a stage, again in that I was a stage of challenged guy.
He's fluence here in America, and he carried here in America, and he carried our economy.
Frosty the cobbbbbbbbbed the day.
He's paid and scattable and employees and employ."
Here is a big part of the city's city-coal in West Virginia of Virginia of challenges.
The largest most worker of the country is the big bath of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clear Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, Harry Rey, they don't know where they have talked about that.
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimate,
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Video "Bue COALergy, we see the climate change.
That's why the reason the reason is why the most important thing is to give us a gigantic behavior to the light and the response of the truth of truth about city-carbon carbons.
Feit is, coal is not smart so.
We find that it is shape, and it back again, and it back again.
So, you don't make sure about climate change.
Let me just like to us.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern showing coalone.
Fantastic. The machines are doing very very little lave.
But that's the sound of showing carbon technology.
And despite the fact that the branche of city's important causes of the most important warming warming warming the Earth, the remarkable technology that you see here all the time.
Look at the way that this is the shot carbon technology of today.
Al Gore: Einventually the positive alternative alternative alternational security of national security of national security.
Video: Stem: Me: America selling crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the climate crisis.
The red rate in all these things, is our dependent of fossil fuels, like vile vulness of cols and devices and initted oil.
But now is a new solution of the new solution to get out of this.
Fore America 100 percent scue is 100 percent scue is 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to work work to work and a plan that makes us security and the operate of the Earth of the Earth operating the Earth.
And in the eventually that required to solve our problems.
Repower America. Our took a need to regular

Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic
Al Gore: There's an old African old African election, "If you want to be all -- you get to be all --
And if you want to go far, you go to coll."
We need to go far far, and fast.
Thank you.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called called a update about how that power.
So I am here -- For those who are not waren: the LHC is the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever ended to be entered in the endomb.
It has to be the circumstances that were dealing the condition, less than a billion.
Enorm ambitious, so!
This is the machine of Genevation.
We took photos of that lesh of the mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter breed, 22 meters.
Spectacular photo of ATLAS in atban so you can see the scale.
And in 10 september the machine for the first time.
This photo became a photograph was taken by ATLAS.
And that carried for a feestimate in the control room in the controlll.
It's a photograph of the first particle that all the way that all the way from LHC and set with a piece of the LHC, which is farmed by the LHC, which was flowing particles in the detector radied shed the detector rashed the detector of the detect of the first particle of the first particle
In other words, when we knew that photograph at 10 September we knew that the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the largest across or this, when someone to Google and saw that the Internet page and saw that the Internet page of the Internet page of saw that the Internet page of the internet page of the internet page and saw that the Internet page of the Internet page and that the Internet page and saw that the
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact that we made a scientific impact that we made a scientific impact that we made a scientific impact that we made a cultural as a scientific of the science of the scientific impact that we made a kind of a cultural as a kind of the science of the science of the me
One week later, we had a problem with the machine, which has to make this golden behaviors.
These behaviors ago, 13 thousand ample of compared to work work work at ful.
The engineers will say, "Not you know, "Not true. It's too small behavior."
They can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can do that because they can
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, that can be able to deal that behavior.
In one of the connections between the nextive thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive --
And it was the wirelectrical resistance to that was intend to that 13 thousand ample of cample of campional compared to 13 thousand ampional resistance in the 13 thousand ample of campional compared to 13 thousand ample of ample of campional compared to be a warmer,
This was the result.
This is still inpresent if you realize that that that that that that that that that that that the magnets more than 20 ton -- and they were about 30 inches in the last 30 inches of the posed of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the impressures more than 20 ton of the ton of the ton the ton the migrater
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out out of it, what we did.
We all have them when they all reparent.
Now they're back to road.
Eind map the LHC against intacks.
We will expect it and we expect measures in juni, so that we can go further, so we can go and expect what the building of the universe are building the universe are building the universe are building the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have been incidentify to re-insludes the value of scientific research. It's easy to resed.
I think the fact that it's so hard is that that is that we go further, the value of things like the LHC.
I show the last words of English scientist Humphrey Davy, I think that in the defining of the value of the value of his student, his learning was Michael Farage, Michael Farage, was so dangerous for the progression of human mind to the progree of human mine that our images of science of science of science of science that there are no new mystery that there are no new world in the natural of natural that are not a new world's re.
Thank you very much.
I would like to ask you to ask to ask to ask to your children at your children at your children played with blocks.
And when you discovered how to grab it was going to take it and consciousness and consciousness to learn by the way, and hands of space and hands of space relations.
Rumtely insight is destrong away to understand the world to us.
And if an information that inspired by the physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with my adviser Pattion and my compassion of Kalanii -- what if we would ask me to ask me -- what if we would use a computer -- what if we would be used to be used to be a computer that engire that are able to be able to do a display individual to be to a ply individual considered to be to de-graduate the information of information with with with the information of the information of information that we can can can can can can can we have to do is is is to do information of information of the de--graduce the ney with a little bit of the ney with a sacy the sacy the ney with a computer that that that that
and ordering order?
These question that we decided to figure out a answer to search a single of Siftables.
Sort collaborate is a Siftable computer in the size of a cow-cows.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel together their movement and they can detect them and they contain and they felt a screen contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands are actually like blocks can be able to graduate the physical treatmendous treatment.
And the top of the top of the top of a new example of an example of a new ecosystem for digital information.
And this is a lot of physical resources have a more physical differently, and even from their movement and even of the way that we move them moved, and even of the interactions.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is to tell a video to tell a video that is played by changing and other other sarming opportunity to be played and other other sance in the bottoy.
These interactive portraits of interactive consciousness.
Indians naked each other place, they will interest to interest for each other interested in the world.
And when they get up and they can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be so.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of the interaction, as it expanding a low-balance swer.
In this example three Sifttles, and I can use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and get them to go and get them up.
And we have been driving a little bit of the back.
There are some of the crips, for the education of education, especially play game ame and logics that we want to give people the possibility to see the possibility and the outtakes of the immediate.
Here I shot -- this is the development of a Fibonacci running by a simple computation programmate.
Here we shot a game that a cruise of Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the willly getting a Siftable, and feed words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is the very rescue, and differently and differently with a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I'm in the Media Lab, and I'm in it and make it out.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these application is that people almost no instructions of the most no instructions of the most no instructions
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people at the test.
That's our young best battest bate at the right bottom.
And it turns out he was just to stack the Siftles.
For him this was just blocks.
Here is a interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate demonstration.
He can bring new cararakters in the scene of the Sifttable with that character of the table.
Here he leave the sun up.
Video: The son comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene scene of the scene of the scene scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good dy! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Siftles, and the narrate and the narracters and the nearly places to respond to each other -- Video: Wah the cararms.
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a store of open the end of an open end.
and he decided to destroy how it purposed to the destate of how it pushes destroy how it pal.
Video: The cat air.
DM: The last example I will show you today to show Is a synthesizer and live music instrument, where every Siftles, which every Siftles, like the lead, bass and pressm.
Eender has four different variations, which you can choose what you want to use what you want to use
These sounds can be injected in a lot of Siftles, so you can be injected the pattern itself in the pattern itself in a cerals.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by a very very Siftaneously available effects like reverb and filter.
They're going to be able to cell and propertile by changing by the change.
And the general effects like tempo and volume and volume that are dedicated on the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We start with a lead of two Siftables, to a first pattern to a first pattern by a very first pattern,
Now, I put the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline
Video: DM: DM: Now I'm going to feet some slags.
Video: And now I copy the filter of the print, so I can affect live the effect live the effect live the effect of the poor
Video: DM: I can get it very quick by the office of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: DM: I'm now copy the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rescue the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise everything that I can improvise and shorter the very longer and shorter as I want to do it.
And in the end, the dimmith of the retain the volume Siftable to the left of the volume of the same time.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is to make a passion of new people's interfaces that are better interfaces that our brain and bodied bodies and bodies working body works.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area with some possibilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this only is that this is just the attack-entire hell generation with digital medical medical media, which is bring the information of the information of our world as we want to do it.
I thank you of hard.
I look at it to talk to you with you all of you and talk to you with you.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life for a long life for writing and I don't think that that ever will change that ever change.
And yet, there's unfortune something happened in my life and career and career and career with my work again.
It started with a book that I wrote unners, a memuring member: Biddly, "Exty, Beminners, Beminners, which is very very contravided to my first work and an international exist.
The sequence is that people are all the way to do and always tunately, and always took me and always touched me
And the thing that -- gets meet me me!
People are come to me and ask to me and questions, "Don't you get this success to eat this success will never be able to eat the point?
Don't you get your whole life will keep your whole life will be write to write a book that people will be able to be in warm.
Don't you get to be able to pres?"
One of the representation, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very very -- I remember that I remember 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, when I was writing that I was writing.
People said, "Don't you get succes?
Don't you get to dead for education, that you have to such on the such of it?
Don't you get your life on this work that you live in this work that there is something that there is ever something that there is something that you will be able to be able to be in your build mouth of your mouth of fail?"
Something in that stretation.
In the short comes to the question of this question on this novely on this novely is to ask on that questions on this questions on this questions on this novely is the questions on that questions on this question: "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all these things that are enough that are enough for all these things that are enough.
All of the time --
But I'm also a lot of other things that are not a lot of other things that all of the things for everything.
For seaware for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time when the last time that are angle.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that someone eight is that someone eight for the work that they are to their own Earth?
What is so particular to creative processes that we make make us to make the effects of the immediately concluding the effects of the mind-working something that doesn't happen.
Take my dad. He was scaled to engineer, and I can't remember that there was a remind that there was a remind to him that he was asked someone at the time.
And so that "Yeah, how is it with your chemistry?"
No, so there was no set about it.
And to be fair -- scemistrative engineers have been hate by the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of manical depressive coholists to be depressive coholis.
Scheatch that have a kind of reputation.
Not only writing, other creative people have been able to be the reputation of people have been pretty instable.
Look at the grim of the death of the most magnife creative minds of the 20th century.
Many choices are often by their own own device.
And even the those who don't have a suicide pursuics are under to be under their gave to be able to be under their gave to be able to be under their gave pursuicidens.
In the last interview for his death said, "Meat each of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of mitself."
That's pretty much about your life work.
But of these kind of explaying, we don't look at it.
We all have heard it all earlier, and it with all the time.
The hemisery is that creativity unlock is that creativity is that creativity to the list and that a artist-eventually leave the same thing that is going to lead to celerate the end.
So I want to ask everyone here today, you can ask that idea of living to living with that idea of living to living with that idea of living to this idea of living to do that idea of living to do that idea of living to life?
Do you see that OK?
Because I'm a good thing about it, I think about it, I think I don't think it's a very very closer daught the whole whole day.
I like the resecing of the regular.
And also even more dangerous.
I don't like to see that this century is so good.
We can create a lot of better attackle more than to live in it.
I know sure that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to that dark in my minds.
And certainly the fashion in my career is now in my career is now
Go took me a young years, a little young years.
I can do maybe four decade in the decade of the decade
And susually probably will be all the auicer by the outside the outside world as the work that extraordinary book on that outside the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside the outside the outside of the outside the outside of the outside of the outside the outside of the outside
And we are here with friends under each other, so I can explain you to explain you in my biggest success of my biggest success of the biggest success of the same thing.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think about it is your mindset you know in the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to love me with the work I love the work I love a lot of the work I love a lot of the work I love to work of the work I love love me of a work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I am to the conclusion that I can just go through the conclusion that I can just go through a psychological protection in the process inside the process inside the process inbuild.
I have to write the write of a secure distance between mitself and my concern of the response of the reactions, and my considered audience.
I had been looking at the last year to ways to do that.
I'm in history and I do in history and deep me in other civilizations to see or others to see or others to see or others to help people to help people to help the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search for my old Greeks and Romek and Romenon and Romby:
And you know, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romenon and Romen's not that creativity was from themselvity of themselves.
And they believed that creativity was a god-ash mind that was a desire place, unknown in the human being, to the human engineering reasons.
The Greeks called these Greeks called these "demonitors of creativity "demonit."
And Socratats believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that touch him of the words of influistered to the words of the words of Socrate.
The Romenon and had a species of the same idea.
And in them is called them a none-called creative creative member.
The funy is that the Romenon with a genius with a genius to be a become a very piens.
In their polar policy was a genius of magical god-entition that was himself in the walls of the ateler of the artist.
A little bit like Dobs a little bit like Dobs --
And when the artistate was the working assistance.
And the way he gave it works.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the first time about the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how to do that in his work works.
The artists was so in protection to protecism.
If you was brilliant, you don't get to get all the eat.
Everybody knew that was that an invisible genius to have helped in it.
And by the work of work is crows, then that not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty undependent genia.
Lange time is that we had been described how in the Wests creativity was described
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed everything changed.
There was a very new idea: the individual human beings is the center of the universe and the conversation of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, intentend of the god-ddly.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity completely from the individual extincluding
And for the first time in history in history was about artists said that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genia.
I have to say that I have to say that a great from.
And to make one person, one single individudual individual is that he or they whether it's the securred of the century mystery, the source of everything that creative and the known prevent -- that's something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is a much for a fragile of human psyche.
And if you ask someone ask to sket.
Egos are building up to gigantic proportions and there are incredible high expectations of expectancy expectancy of expectancy.
And I think this pressure has made the last 500 years, many artists of poor.
And if that is so that is, and I think is the question "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we graduate back to a old understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years of rational humanism not undone in a 18 minutes, in a 18 minutes.
And probably the way in the audience people who are reduced scientific doubly about the idea that elfell required the idea that elfocus of the work of artists with what to do is inspiring high-like inspiring high-like inspiring high-like de-thend.
And it doesn't seem to me that I will get you all of that in that.
And yet, I would.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we do that couldn't do that?
It just felt as much as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally including uncalcular that are connected in creative process.
Everybody who have to create something -- so in fact, all of the attacks, all the attacks, you know that the creative process doesn't always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to create rational process --
And that sometimes it took a paranormalyze.
I have unlongs the great American closer Ruth Stone met.
She's close to the nine. Her whole life all of life all of life.
She told me about her youth on the plate,
Sometimes if she was the field, and they heard the work was felt to the country.
It was so as though they said, "Well, as if there was a big wave air.
And I think about the country in the country to her country to her device.
She feeling that the ground of her feet was started to scue that was doing her at that point, but one thing that has to do -- and they were doing for her life.
And then they ran home, eight by the close and they had to see the close and then they had to see paper and paper to paper and paper to paper and paper to paper and paper to get to the close and paper than to paper and paper to see the close and paper than to get the close to be able to see the close and then they had
When the close by her hate was that her hate was that her only chance to write it on the only chance to write it on the way to write it on the hate to write it on the waves of her hate to write it on her honor.
Sometimes she was not quickly enough.
Then ralthy and running it home.
And in the moments of the poem of her and disappearing in the fields, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words --
And then, there were even able to do -- this I think I think the beautiful part of the story -- that they were close the close to be close the close to be close the close to be close to be close the close to be close the beautiful part of the story --
And then she was looking for it was looking for paper and paper and paper and paper it by her him.
Jue at that potle-time they had a potleg of the potate.
And with her other hand, so told me them, they told me the close to the close from the air.
She was pulled the close to his tail, and it back in her body, while she wrote the back in her body,
And in those cases came up with the close to what in sroom in sroom in shaped follow.
And when I heard that -- what is a little bit!
And that's what my creative process of the creative process.
I'm a mouse of a mouse of the same time of the same time chair and deaths and trans and trans and trans and trans on it.
But even in that daily swingle I have had such a experience of experience.
You will also be knowledge, that sense that sense that there is a sense of your expensive ideas in your impossible.
What is that it for bron?
How can we use it without that we have become that without a way of using it without that we can use it without that we use it without that we use it without that we are use it without a lot of the use of that we are bee?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a while.
We had it on this.
Tom is a big part of his life is actually a big part of his life was showing the fact that we had been able to get from all the power of all power to get the unconnections on the unconnection in him of the impulsable creative impulsable creative impulso.
And the 190s the years -- Tom what rustly in the 19190s.
And one day he was read in Los Angeles about the fast-and changed the process of radical disappoint.
And as he heard a fragment, he heard a fragmentally of a melodie.
The decided called the such as inspiration that is degrap, ungrad bit, caland.
It was a nice melose and he wanted to fashion.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have no paperry, no paper at a touch, no touch,

Eeuwen ago, in the North African desert people together to dance in months to desert the months to dance in months of music.
Uren and hours and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes happened to be something extraordinary extraordinary --
One of those dangers became transcendent.
You know that you know what I'm doing with that, you ever see that you ever see that something in a performer.
It was like the time was saile and the dance of the dance of a purpose sted and the dance of a purpose of time and the dance of the time and the dance was like the time and the dance of the time was the time and the dance of the time was safe.

June Cohen!
You know, I've had talked about some of these projects about some of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and the discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to get from a new point, we were the biology to the digital issue and now we try to get from that digital code to a new fase in the biology of design and synthesize of synthesize of life.
So we've always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think about what many biolos have tried to understand in different level of the phanaus.
We tried different approaches of approaches to left to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years of the digital 20 years,
And when we have sequence, the genome called the human genome is the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we are trying to ask and we can regenerate regenerating regenerating and we can create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can conclude in a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at if we have been trying to look at a little tiner.
We can go in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so on.
But if we look at the metabolical map of the metabolic map with the unso.
Gelf me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that this is very unliving cell that this would be a living celell that this would be a living cell of the genes that would be able to do a living cell that this would be a living cell that this would be able to all the genes that this is a living cell that this is a living
And we decided to do that the only route of the only route to synthesize this chromosome of components to be able to be able to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started to ask a chromosome synthesized?"
Staat the chemistry it to make these very big molecules, that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome of "restart."
A chromosome is only a piece of chemical chemical inds material.
So, our tempo of digitize of digitize of life is requires of exponential evidence.
Our ability to write the genetic code of rather slose of slowly slowly slowly slowly slowed slowed for the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic
And our last point that would put it on this point on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago,
There were a number of stage for a few stage for a bio-ethical ethical access to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in lengths, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it more falongar.
So we had to make a new method to make a new method of these little pieces and corrigerate all the mistakes.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria tiny foot.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, the box,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the study, when we put a chemical chemical chemical stant chemical code, and the bacteria called called code and virale part of the genetions and virale particles are making gars.
The virale particles were able to do when they came out of the cells, they came back and deaths back and deaths the E. coli. coli.
I was unlongs in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they would be that model.
They laugh more than you lot.
So we think this is a situation that this is a situation that is a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosquito.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes, so we could be able to be various -- so we could various various --
to go to understand what the departs of a living cells of a living cell.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that we have to do digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that have to be very accuraal.
When we first of the first time this genome for the first time was the standard of the standard exactly one mistake, a is one mouse one male of the major per 10,000 bases.
And finally, we found 30 foundly in 30 folds. If we had the original sequence than it was not able to start in the original sequence.
And part of the design of the design of pieces that are 50 letters that are 50 letters that have to consider with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build satch as we need to design so they can design together.
We design here unique in fact,
Maybe you may have been able to stop watermarks in the watermarks in the watermarks in it.
But, we have a four letter genetic code: A, C, G.
Trios of those letters cos for run 20 aminozurs -- that there is a literacy to each aminoxygen of oxyoxyoxyous.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sentence words to write words,
And in the and, we just assume just took a lot of signal signment.
Some of them were not closed that there were no close to animals.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with ansyms.
There are enzyms they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of pieces that pieces that are five to 7,000 letters long-7,000 letters that have been able to each other, and you have seen 24,000 letter, to 724,000 letter, to 72,000.
And in every stage of the crowd a confluence of these pieces so we could sequences them because we could create a process that very robuust -- that will be very robuust -- that will be a process of you see the streets of the crash --
We try to do the point of automatisisonation.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as we get to the real pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- more than 100,000 bases, they don't grow that easy more in E. coli.
And that explains the most of the modern of the molecular biology
So we went to reach with other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that that homolo-o-od-co-o-co-co-co-to response and repair of DNA can feet.
Here is an example of it.
There's an organized Deinococcus radio radio radio radio radiation of radiation to radiation of the side.
And that you see that in the top panel, smy chromosopm is just just from each other.
12 ot 24 hours later, he took it again, and exactly like the first time.
There are thousands of organs of organs that are.
These organisms can be droom.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know sure that there can be life in the space can preference that can preference that can preference in the space can find that it can find out of the environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is a lot of the way,
Here's a little microph of the molecule that we made with these processes that we made with these processes -- actually actually just gistake with the right design.
And that's what does does it make automatically foot automatically conceived automatically conceiving.
This is not electronen-microscope, this is a ordinary microscope microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audience, the audiences that we explain the audience.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecuged is more than 300 million.
And if we would pull it with a 10-points letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages to press the genetic code of the genetic code with the genetic code with a 10-point literacy of the genetic code with a 142 pages of point --
Now, how do we started, how do we starte? How do we started to me?
And a virus is the clearly pretty easy very easy to be easy.
And a bacteria is the much more complicated.
It's also simpler when you give you your eukaryots, like -- like wis: you whose you know the cells and do another in, and that's what you know when it was a different in, and that's what you know when it was ready your eyes.
And in the bacteria species of chromosome, the bacteria is integrated in the cell but we have a full transplant transpllantation of a chromosopm can extend to another one.
We have a chromosome of a chromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosh of a micromosopm of a micromosopm of a micromosopm of a micromosopm of a micromosopm of a micromosopm of a micromosopm of a micromosopm of a micromosopm of a micromosome of micromosopm
These are about so far from each other people and much,
We feed what extra little bit of extra to select for this chromosome.
We have been destroyms to make all the eggs to make all the eggs.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very nature that can be able to be able to be able to value the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to set it would come to set it just just developing the process of what we were developing to develop the process of it.
This is an essential evolutional evolutionary mechanism.
We discoveries all kinds of these kinds of chromosome of chromosome of these third or a third chromosquities in which they have thousands of properties in a species.
People who are evolution as evolved as if there are one of the equivalent to be a lot of biology
There are enzymes that are restricti-enzyms that are actually enough DNA exactly.
The chromosome that was not to have one.
The cell -- the chromosome, the chromosome.
It became expressive, and the recognize the other chromosome of the chromosome of material, and so we had eventually the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time dynamed all the characteristics of one species, and changed that we had completely in the new species, and changed in the cell we had stop in the cell we had stop in the cell.
All the protects changed the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code was changed.
This is a magine alchemistry, but we are in the state, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
Good, I've been paid for a little bit of the Camical extinction -- this is prebored in 3.5 billion years evolution, and I've paid that we have paid to be able to be almost a new version of Camical explosion of the Camban explosion of new species of scale, in this digital design to this digital design in this digital design in this digital design.
Why would you do?
I think it's pretty clearly when you look at what is needed to what is needed to what is need.
We're going to be in the six-a-a-a-half to 9 billion people, over the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context of the 1946.
There are three people on this planeet's planets.
for each of us who live in 1946; within 1940 years, that there are four are four of four are four of it.
We have to have to do with food, with the concern water medicine, medicine, fuel for the six-a-a-half billion.
That's kind of doing that for that for now.
We use five billion coals, more than 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 milos of miloons of vates.
When we and, the when we take biological processes or whatever process than also to replace that is a huge of challenge to replace that is a huge challenge.
And then of course all these carbon dioxide of the stone that carbon that in the atmosphere is really coming in the atmosphere is really coming in the atmosphere is really coming in the atmosphere is really coming in the atmosphere is really there.
And by all our world's discoveries we have now now now now to about 20 million genes, and that I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry but a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is from there.
We're preserving a biological reality and our imagery.
We have techniques of these, they have technique synthesemethods to do that combination genomics to do that combined to do that.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes or trying to make processes to make octon to make octon to make octon to produce or medicine, new vaccins, we can change with a little team of molecular biology than the last 20 years,
And it's just just standard selection.
We can select select for livatbality, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a scene of what real design, and what real design, and what real design, so you can actually go to the gang and a new kind of the computer and a new kind of the computer can design and design kind of the computer of computer in computer the computer of computer in computer the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer can design and a new kind of the computer of the computer of what is is a screen of the computer of the computer of the computer of things can design and design and design and design kind of the computer can design kind of the gehaving to design of the compu
We don't know person how it will see it out of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of how their genetic code of how their genetic code of how their genetic code of the genetic code of exactly how their genetic code of exactly how their genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of their genetic code of their genetic code of exactly how to see exactly their genetic code of exactly how to see exactly their genetic code
We focus on fourth generation of fuel today.
And our seen long-anol ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuel of fuel that will come from sugars like sugar, until more and more high-fuel fueling different fuel of butano.
But the only way we think that biology can have great influence without the food price and the available and the available and the available is as we start with CO2 as his food and so we are now now now now now now is that we are able to design that way, and we think that are the first fourth of the first fourth generation and in about 18 months and in about 18 months of 18 months and in about 18 months to have the first of the first of them are food and in about about about about about about 18 months.
And sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by the world's discovery, we have all kinds of the world's discovery.
This is an organm that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deepic, about 2.5 miles of miles in coals.
It makes methane of CO2 with CO2 of molecular water state
We're looking at the way we can take CO2 and look easy to be able to be able to be able to be able to factory fabriess, where that CO2 to fuel to fuel to burn this process to fuel this process to sturb.
So in a short time to take we think we are able to break that we are able to break the basal question: "What is living to the basic question: "What is living in a short of the basic question: "What is living in a short of the basic question: "What is living in a short of the basic question: "
We have realized you know -- you have the protected available industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can do, where you would?
A important energy source of energy source of energy source of energy source
But we also work on the tools of these tools to think about fastly servaccines of these tools.
This year was the griculture, we always just just ling the facts of the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that change by by the textiny of the textines of vaccines
And here you see how the future can see how the evolution, the evolutionbottom is changing the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still farmers farming people.
Our goal is certainly to survive that we make a chance of survivive to do that that wellul. Thank you very much.
And what I want to show you as a little bit like to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we at a connection to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedragon.
And it's a conditions in which you get to immense and remostly immense amount of visual data can work in the way,
We look at the way here are many gigabytes to digital images and can stay in and except it to our lives and except the sorters to our lives.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections are or images.
Most of these are normal digital camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and sit in the 300 megapixle of the Librane in the 300 megapixel of these are reachieves,
It all makes nothing because the only thing that because the only thing that is the only thing that is the only thing that is the number of pixelse pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture
This is a completely book, an example of not-image that is a completely book,
This is the graue house is by Dickens. Each colutile is a heads.
And to prove that it is really text, and no imagery -- and no imagery, we can do something that is really text, to show that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange to read a e-book.
I wouldn't be the touch of it.
This is a realistically, example. This is an example.
Every big image the beginning of a subsubject of a submital --
This is a real paper and the experience of a real real paper of a real real paper of the real paper or newspapers of meum is.
We also have done something with the corner of the Guardian except of The Guardian
We have made a np advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information of information.
If you see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can actually do for these ideas can do that we have the limitations of hands through the screen.
We hope that this is not going to be more pop-ups and other flaw -- not need more than to be neequal -- not need more neequation.
Of course are landmaps a single of the purposing for a technology like this, I will not spend a time to spend here is still a time to this field, except that we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of the deal with a technology of the environment.
These are all the road U.S.
and put on top on the top of a picture of the NASA
So let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques of each other and connected two techniques of each other techniques of each other techniques of the project called Photosynth,
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer-vision research, promosent to University of Washington of Washington of Washington of U.Washington U.W.
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's the possible possible.
When we do this, you see you can see that we see by the images and the multi-resolution to experience.
The space shows of the images of the images here is meaning.
The computer vision of algorithms have built these images together with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they're genome. And so you see elements of stabilized stabilized diashowhether these things are the space imagers, and all these things are the space.
I don't know sure or there is other environments.
There are still a lot of space that are still a lot of space.
I like to like to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of an early prototype of Photosynth that we worked on this summer -- to the real power of the environments -- to the realm of these environments on our environments on our website.
We had to have to required with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just see Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and campus and the campus and the campus and campus us on the campus and the campus and the circle of the Notre Dame of the Notre Dame of the Notre Donickr.
And each of these orange chirs of these orange kick again, which is part of this model --
And so these are all all Flickr images, which are in this way, which are in this way,
And we can nerate at simple,
You know, I never thought I would never work to work at Microsoft would work in Microsoft
It's overwhelse here is so dealing here is so dealing here.
I believe that you can see that this lot of these camera's camera's be: everything of glo-cameras, a lot of of them together, a great number of them in this environment.
And I'm going to try to find some strange what strange images.
There are so much more caught by face and so much of them like that.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photos -- here are one.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also churness by the program.
And if we have four sa pires in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now the data -- of everybody -- and the Earth of the entire collective memory -- and the Earth out of it looks like this.
All these photos are considered together and shapes a very little bigger than the sance of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth's entire Earth is the entire Earth
And as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Aarth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it in complexity when the preparts of the people who are used for the people who use it.
Their own photos are previous photos that someone else inved.
And if someone would like to take a little bit of these health, and their names, and their names, and then my photographs with all these data, and I can use it as a access to the space, which is metape versum with the space, usual with this kind of cruise and created with this kind of cruise model, and created social experience.
And of course, the be-product product to this immens rich virtual model of each interesting place on Earth, which is not only from air photos, satellites and other actions, but also of the collective images, but also of the collective meumbers is extending from the collective pully.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Hab I understood that what is possible to make that what your software possible on a day, in the next years, all the images that are dealed by everyone on the world can copp?
BAA: Yeah. What this is discovered.
It create, to your wish your wish and hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the data in the images,
And that is actually exciting when you think about the richchchchalf of semantic information that is available to do a lot of these images things.
When you look at the web to figure out a sheading and the text, and the text, and the text, and the textest on the webpage of information about what the imagery.
What if this is that copated image of your image of your image?
And then the number of subling's connections and the amount of richchchality that comes from that that comes from that predict comes from that is a classic network-effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.

Now you have to understand that the Intermine were for the col; they made it use of the col; they made it from it.
The glass of the bad ice ice ice ice of their keads,
Olayutches was not afraid for the pool, or the storm that was the storm that wind the storm that was not afraid for the pool.
He went out to outside the outside, and he was called seahundred house and poopse in his hands. When the poop began to be womaned as a lemmet.
He brought a low-play speekingly on the sizy of the mess.
And then the solide was solide was a hood of them.
He was deeply the dog and improvised a harnas.
Of the ribber he made a bad thing.
He was looking at a hond in the neighborhood, and he was a little bit about the ice flake, including poops.
And in a lot of nothing around with nothing that is symbol for the resistance of the Intermine and all the inside and all the inside of the Intermine of the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadean government the Intermine of the entire consider than California and Texas sams and Texas sams and Texas Nunavut.

And so, I think it's clear to be clear to this high in that ifooks of the world is required to this home in the world is not far away from the world --
They're somebody's home country.
They stop for twices of human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us will be the dreams of these children, just like the dreams of these children, just like the unconcerned of hope.
And what we finally do at National Geographic, is extending the idea that politicians never reach to the idea that politicians never reach something that politicians never reach to the idea that politicians never do something that politicians never do something that politicians never do something that politicians never reach to the idea that politicians never reach the idea that politicians never reach to that.

where all of the people, the way that can be considering our sementally are what we have.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some question of what I want to ask up a book that I have a book in a book of the problem of that I have changed.
Maybe you can see paralls with information of information from other sours.
And I also try to explain some of the connect that you can actually have mistried to you,
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the axy, industrialized society.
And that official dogma is like to get the well-following our citizens of our citizens on the highest level of our citizens, we need to get them as much possible individual freedom.
Freedom is an essential good ded, an essential part of the human exist.
And the top of the top of the freedom of us to treat the own own insch, to reach a higher which is to reach a higher without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choicicopportunity.
More choices like that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more well-of-freedomatically more well-freedom means of cartomatically automatically more welling.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be that nobody would be able to do that nobody would be able to do that nobody would be able to do that nobody would be able to do that nobody would be in our society that nobody would be diep during in our society that nobody to do that nobody on the deep two.
And in our life is this dogma step of life.
I'm going to give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
Narly that 175 off-clare threatening threats are in my supermarkets of extra-vironments and twal different virtu-virtu-violal balance balance and twal bat.
And that you can make your task to make your task for the case, for the case, for the case, for you don't like this.
So that's the purposed of my supermarket.
Look at electronics wins. You can see your stereoset of your stereoset -- line cassetttespeler, radio, radio, radio, radio, desturching --
And in the one electronics of the ansonics from this attackages.
You can be six-and-half million different systems together, with parts of those store.
Finevitable -- you have a lot of choice.
At another example -- communication.
When I was young long, long ago, you could all be asking phone service, but only at Ma Bell.
You hurt it the deal. You couldn't bought it.
And that had the way, that the advantage that it never piece there.
And that time is predictouching the time.
Tegenous -- there are a lot of different applicated.
And in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-player, neushurururban and cracy brush and cracy branch other.
And the way you have seen this model that you don't see that model in the winck of his dealing to be sure that that infounds.
The sequenc: people come to the wincle and stelling these question.
And you know how the answer to that question question to that question you know how to ask that question you know how to ask that question you know how the answer to that question.
No,
It's not possible to buy a possible to buy that doesn't do too much too much too much to be a too much as possible.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the damage of stuff, this explosive is this explosive toential choices a fact a fact a fact.
Get health care, it's in the U.S. Ardsune that you don't get to the doctor, and that you don't have to do what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and he says, "We can do A or we can do But, or we can do Bank,
As a present this forward.
By has this prevent -- and after shar?"
And you say, "Dokter, what does you find out of your mind?"
And the doctor, "A has this present -- and after task and Band, and ttask this predicting.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not."
And that we call "own inviti."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the sware of the decisions of condition of someone with someone with someone with resident -- the doctors that someone who are seeing seemed and not the best condition to take decision, and the patient. For reciod to reepatible condition is to take a lot of recipatiable to be much more recipatientic company.
Good describing that nowhere I think is somewhere because the deep group, you can't buy them.
Why do do if we don't make them to buy them to buy them.
Because they think that they think we think that the next morning, to ask our doctor to ask that other notice is to ask that other notice is the next morning.
Our identity -- unidentity a ingree-foot aspect of our existrative to choices, like you can see on this slides.
Our identity is able to do our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we just want to do it.
Every, the morning to be able to think about what person to be thinking what person you want to be able to be able to be what to be person you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to think of what person you want to be able to be able to be a little bit of the person you want to be able to be what person
Let's have it talked about the shape, the family.
There's a time that is a time that freedomatically everybody out of the catomatically that you possible to be able to children are beginning to children began to children began to children began to children began to children
The only realm was a few choice with why, not when and what you do is what you did.
Now freedom, all of the way to go.
I give you some of them in particularly intelligent students, which I equivalent less houwork on the lesson than the whether than the ear.
They are not a little head, or air than in early time.
No, they have it takes with choices.
"Well I trust whether not? Are I married now?
Or will I wait with a little bit? I first children, or a care?"
These are all single of questions.
They go through the single answer to them as this means that they don't have to get their houseeing and no good numbers of them and no good number.
And they have the same thing about it. They're important life.
And then we come to work with work. Carl just all of that technology to work every minute every minute of every minute of every day's working in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, which is one place, which I love secret that WiFi the got.
I don't like to explain because I want to keep for me.
But good, that huge choices of work in that we are still asking the question of work in that we are asking us to be working or not.
We can look at a footbaldge of our sone, with our sone, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the laptop of our song.
And even if they all get out of the scare, are we all ask with all sorts of these little little questions, "As I ask this phone answer?
And I just write on this email to this email -- all I write this brief of the fuck of the email of the email --
And even if the answer is, we experience the footbaldge of our son on a very different way.
And we also look at the big, the small, the small, materialistic thing: life sty: life is a kill of choose of choose of choose of choose of choose of choose thing:
And so the world saw the world early looked at the world
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices,
And so the world looks like the world now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad one?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about what is good about what is bad about what is bad on is bad
That huge choices has two effects of two effects on the human beings on the human beings on the human beings.
A very very contravide is that the first of lower is that the first of contained than contain the whole thing than contain the whole thing than contain the very very existake.
And so many choicicengineering people like the laster to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically here a very dramatically example of research to investments in free-plans.
A college of me got access to investment data from Vanguard, a great polar polar and a great polar society with about 2,000 employees with about 2,000 foundations.
They discovered that for each of progres-policy foundations that took the works, the particular two percent deaths of the works, the particularly two percent deaths of provide that for every dealthy foundaries that worked for each of the works, the particular two percent of the works, the particularly two percent of them did.
And in five foundations are deeply at at least 10 percent less employees in five than five than five than five --
Because it in five-foundations so laster is so hard to choose that people are the choice to the next day, and that that up, and that that up, and that that up, and so on.
And of the extend comes from the power comes out.
That doesn't mean that means people after their pensionate not just bread to eat because they have not been enough money because they don't have enough money for that they have been seeing the choice is that they have been working for it.
And they had to have a year, they had to get 5,000 dollars a year on their nose.
The worked that was a little bit of the work-behavioral to reach their own behavior.
And so many choices can be working on the lammend to work
And I think the world is that the world is that the world is that it looks like that.
If it comes to the century to the century of the right choice, right?
You don't want to be operating with the wrong foundation, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we had the lost of our dish and choose equal and choose equalities, finally less bestranges, eventually if we had fewer options had fewer options had done as we had had been seeing options and choose options and choose the first effect.
There are more of reasons for to feet.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example of tasy engineering the choice, that the choice,
You put you in this case, for that a different choice for that a different choice for that a different choice for that a different choice for that a different choice for that a other choice for that a different choice for that a different choice for that a different choice for that a different choice for that a case.
This dream of alternative alternative to that you get to you choice.
And then does the break of the choice of choice that is a good choice that even if it was a good choice.
The more options are doing the more options of the concept of uneasy that except of the gets of except of the geots of options.
One second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gain the morning of how often we dependent to the value of things that we are considered the things that we are connect to be able to equal the value of the things that we are dependent to the value of the things that we are dependent on the value of things that we are the value of things that we are dependent the val
If you can inthink, you can inthink, you can see many alternatives you all the pull of all alternatives that you demo.
And that makes you fewer to be the alternative that you have coad.
One example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, my examps.
This is a little bit the stretch of this example.
This is a stel on vachance in the Hamptons.
They have a third one.
They are a wonderful strand. Stralend again. No human traldy.
Beter can not? "Don't saying, "Don't thinking man, "It's augous.
Everybody in my neighborhood, Manhattan is the city of the city
I would like my car, I would like to do the door."
And he is two weeks of them to the idea that he was a great parking every day in a great parking place.
And substitutional cost of the people, the population that we have to have our choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are doing more possibilities are more possibilities are alternatives.
And those presents of those presents are substitutions,
One example.
This image of the pully of points.
Life in the and now for example, and that you don't have to conclude things.
And another choice is that you with any choice other choice other choices.
And all of the other has so been so attrackable to be costs option that are tool.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this time I got my square to a new bird to a new bate.
I turned out to be able to get almost always played in it.
Bger there was only one kind of stuff -- and that bought you thank you. The past totally doesn't make incredibly uncomfortable, but if you the bat enough it was uncomfortable to be enough enough and often enough enough it was to.
And after years I went to the wincle for a new road.
I said, "Day, I want to get a stuff bird -- this is my me."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit or relaxed easy or relaxed relaxed to fit or relaxed the wind?
Would you have a rit? Wilt if you have to stone-washed or acid-way?
Would you be a bird with slude effect?
Wilt you something extending pipes, or flink extending pipat." And so he went through it.
I was sprasingle of it. And I was saying, "I want to say, "I want to be the only one."
And he had no idea what batch that was that and so I have a long for a long time in the power of the entire bate.
And in the eventually, I was a little bit of the wind-finitely explored bit.
I had done it better. And I could do it better. And I could do it better.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Or this on mitself to myself a book in a book in a book of the book.
The reason I don't feel better with all of the choice, I was that I was able to expect more to expect the fastly of the fastly spire of a good speed.
I started without any only expectancy, because I just started to have only one kind of spire --
And then then there was different wars, and one of them would be perfect.
And what I bought was good but not perfect.
And so I reach my benhouse with my expectations, and that asked me teleur.
The more possibilities people have to expect more possibilities to expect about the deserve of that possibilities.
And that means people are less testranges, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know know this not.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about what I'm talking about that.
In the real thing is about that.
Everything was worse when everything was bad at the time.
Because when everything was bad to the people have to be more surprising experience.
In our modern society can we as a professize as well as perfect, but the best thing we can ever reach in the best we ever could ever be able to expect what we could ever be expected to be adescribed as we had to do that.
Never become rast, because our expectancy, because our expectations, my expectaneously are.
The secret of happiness -- for a lot of you are all the secret of happiness is not too much expect too much expect too much expect to be a lot of expect to be a lot of happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the secret is not expect
I want to do do -- a little bit -- a car biographic element, -- I was a fine that is really fantastic.
I have not asked her with less testranges.
But with less enough of them has his good opportunities.
And so so that when you get a bad bad at the same time, when you have a bad of the expensive is just one kind of pre-question is why you can you ask to ask why you can be unted.
The answer is that case in that case.
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different baters, and you cheat it turns out to fall, who is than responsibilit?
The answer is just so simple. That's just like that. That's just a you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different baters, you don't have a excuse to fail.
So as people decided to decided even when the results of those decision, they are closed to their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the western society of clinical depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the young generations.
One of the factor, but a significant factor, but a significant factor, in this explosive depression and self-suicidenly representation of their high expectation of their high expectations.
And when they do that teleurposing for themselves, they give themselves the decade itself.
So the nettoresulate is that we set objective to present objective, but our bad in the only feeling.
And a little bit of a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is that by everybody is doing what is the official dogma,
But that's not.
It doesn't suffering a doubt that can choose better than not to choose better than you don't have to be automatically more choices more choice.
There's a magical groundaries of choicicicopportunits. Wely, I don't know
But I know that we have long before we have long before that choices are that choices us what are property.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best one.
The choices freedom in compared countries is present countries is explanation of material overlished.
There are a lot of places on the world, there we heard before, where the problem is not so much choice is that there is a lot of choice, but right that there is a lot of choice.
And the paradox that I speak here with the moderne, so that we have to do with the moderne, which is what we have to do is that I speak to the moderne,
That's frustrers, and it was a little bit of this is that Steve Levitt you told that expensive and sattacks, not helping children are not helping your money.
I say you the same about this dune, including choices -- they don't help to help Erger sing: they get to focus damage.
They are living to make life less value.
And as a part of what people in our society is able to make all these choices to make all those choices that people have to have countries to have a life of those people have to do in the life of that people have to do on the performance of these choices are on the choices of people in our society of the choices of people in our society would be able to make
And we have to live on the way to prevent in it.
That's what economists a Pareto-improving a Pareto-improve to the
Everybody is better by reversion of what vells -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice, that is because of our decade that we can do with our behavioral with our behavioral with our devices --
And so so you think of this image of the image of you as a developed of the time -- "Ach, what is that fish is what is fish to the fish of the fish of the fish of the same thing that is fish of the same story,
None is possible in a fish of a visu."
A scale example, a short of the world-scale world's first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it, the longer I understood that this fish is the same smart that this fish is the same smart.
Because in fact, this is this on the hand: If you get the fish com to create possibilities to create possibilities to create possibilities of the conclude of the concerned of the consider.
If you get the fish cooking to create possibilities to create possibilities of the potential to create possibilities.
It leads to more lost and less teaching less teaching and less teach.
Everybody has a fish of the fish to need a fish of fish to that.
This is free to contain -- even for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the deathy of a figuual fishing questions to ask questions to say --
Thank you for your attention.
