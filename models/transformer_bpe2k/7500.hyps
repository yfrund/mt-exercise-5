But this is actually the entire of this specific problem because it doesn't have the didness of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this specific problem.
The ice is on the North Poil is in a sense of squart of our global climate system.
It's called in the winter and crimpt in the six in the six in the six.
The next so, I show is a version of what happened is a version of what happened to the last 25 years is happened.
The permanentire is attacky in room.
As you see, it was going to dark up to dark blue.
That's the single of ice ice ice ice time,
And the crimpt in the six in the six
The soke the permanentire eass, five years older, is almost like blood or is like blood that from the body.
In 25 years is the one of this is going to go to this in this room
And that's a problem because the free-fror in the North IJssea heart and there is a very big amount of fellow lower wombs and the death, when it was dealth, and it deal in meth,

It comes back in the water reservicires in the water reservice.
And as you could learn the predictions are the predictable.
This is the world evidence has been ago to a behavior to a beautiful style of fours.
And the number of course, the whole world is in the world is including a unbeliefic and never seen seen in the world.
Four time in the last 30 years in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at the same of a historic context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 degreater to CO2 degreater every 24 hours --
25 5 miles every day in our oceans, Keat the eye building, Keat the United Stillic building from America, which is a lot of the Indian ent, there is a behavior, there is a behavious disouth, there is a behavil of the oceans.
The only big war of the surface of the Earth, nature of the Earth, which is the refly laborate of the phossil brands of pictures of phossil fueling and the squarking.
Oil is a problem and city, and stead is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest exciting of the two largest choters,
And there was a lot more cities to build another carbon centrales of building carbon cools
But we see a enough thing.
These are the cities of carbon which the bban was indeed in the last last years and where grandalternative years and where green alternatives working on the last 'alternative works.
There's a political stree-free-free-in our country.
The step -- and olie-industry gave in shapes of 250 million dollars to promots, which is a cool cool of promots, which is a consistant is.
And that picture of me to something thinking about something thinking about it.
And then the guys was in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally model.
You probably see it probably seen in the news in the news of it.
This is the one after one after one after one after America.
This happened around the Kerst.

Here is a big part of the city-cool in West Virginia day.
The largest working of the country is the big battace of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanguguguy: "Lat me duce be a clearly argument. Al Gore, Harry Pelosi, Harry Reassi, they don't know where they don't know what they have to have it about talking about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on your tape campaigns on too.
This is a piece of a piece of a single of it.
Fideo "Bue COLwory, we see the climate change.

But that's the sound of scree cools of cools technology.
And the fact that the fact that the focus of the most important important is one of the most important warming of the Earth, change the opportunity of the Earth, the opportunity of the majs.
Look at the scree of carbon technology of cools of today.

But now there's a durb, new solution to this is to this from this is going to get to this is going to get to this for this.
Fore America is about 100 percent scengaged electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to get a plan that is a plan that is a plan that is made us and the opportunity of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth
And then it was a solution that enough is to solve our problems to solve our problems on our problems of solving our problems of it.

We have to go to go and fail.
Thank you.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I got back to come back to a update about how that machine works.
So here is I am now. Finions that don't have waren't the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever education, 27 kilometers in entreatment.
It has to be the enough needs to be able to see, less than a billion.
Enorm ambitius, dus!
This is the machine is the machine Geney.
We have been photos of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors where I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLASSan inan inside the scale.
And in 10 september of seping the machine for the first one.
This picture was called ATLAS.
That carry for a facestiny in the control of controlll.
It's a picture of the first particle that helping the first particle that helping around the LHC ging, and with a piece of the LHC, which is in the detector in the detector in the detector of the detector of the detect of the LHC,
And then we had to go on 10 September on 10 September we knew that the machine words, which is a huge government.
I don't know if this is the largest across the largest across and then somebody to Google and saw that the Internet pages there so that the Internet page.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we made made a scientific impact that means we made a scientific impact that means we have a scientific impact that means we have a scientific impact that we have made a scientific impact that we have a scientific impact
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to make this golds.
And that behaviors 13 thousand of the powerful powerful forces.
The engineers will say, "Not you will say, "Not value is all the way to small behavior."
They can do because they can do superidend his temperaturies.
So on 271 grads, colder than the gar, and then the gars, that can behaviors that behavior.
In one of the neine between the neine between the neine of thousand magnets in the LHC, siat a constructive.
And then it was a blood thing blace was an electrical weather, and it was a thousand cample of thousand cample of cample res.
This was the result.
This is still inpressure if you realize that magnets that magnets more than 20 ton weas, and they have about 30 centers.
We civide about 50 monkets.
We had to take them out of stories, what we did it.
We all have been eparent.
Now they are back to wea.
Eind mouse will be the LHC against against the LHC againtace.
We will go to the sense and we can expect in your uni or notics in your uni or now, so we can go to the build of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, that have insounces the debate of scientific requiresearch. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy.
I think it's the fact that it's so hard to be a little bit of the fact that we go to move the LHC. .
I show the last words on the English scientists to the English Davy, demotion of the values of the value of the value of his living his living to his left his living to the engaged this said, "No something like this is so dangerous for the human beings of the human beings of our images of human beings that we are not the invented to the world that we are not a new new that that we have to be read that that that that we don't have have have to have to have the newded in the frotombon that in the world in the last last last last last last last words of our our our our our explplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplplant that that that that that that that that
Thank you.
I would like to ask you go back to your child at your child, when you know, when you played with your blocks.
And then you discovered how you had to take to graduate and the conscioup, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and the hand, and the hand, and the hand,
Rimtely insight, because with the world to understand the world to understand the world to have the world to have it.
If a information inspired inspired by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- and with my adviseor Pattion and my adviseor Pattion and my meworker, I started to asking me -- what we would be a computer that we could use a computer that would be used to ask me that environment, and a digital of the write that we can have a crify to the crapid that we can have a shappeaction of the environments that we can have to have the enjojojobbbbbith that can we can we can can can we have to take information with with the engingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingingineer, and be be be be be be be be
and you can have ordering like to do it?
This question of us so so that we decided to be a answer, by building the building of Siftables.
Cort together is a Siftable computer is a interactive computer of a cooky.
They can be able to the hand they can be able to detect their movement and they are going to detect a screen and they are frottes.
The nuclear is the physical hands of physical handely, just like blocks like blocks to graduate the flows.
And there are Siftables a example of an example of an new ecosystem for the war of digital information.
And that this help-such ch a more physical differentire of their movement and of their movement and even of the way we move them and even of the way we move them are different new and some new interaction, there are different interactions.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is instituted to tell a video to tell you to have a video to be played to be a video and others --
These interactive portrained to be able to each other.
Indians are going to each other, they will be able to each other.
And if they are enjobs, they can be able to be similar what they can be similar.
And they move movement and helling.
We realized algauing that one of the interesting of the interesting of these interactive, the use of these interactive, the use of the interaction, as it was a shape, like it was a listop.
In this example three Siftables of three Siftables for and I can use them to go to a little bit of a lege of good, where they are going to be able to go to to go to to go to to a little bit of the good.
If we have been thinking about it.
There are some cributches for the education of education, mathematics with language and logics that we want to give people the possibility things that we want to give things that you care are going to see things that we are the possibility of sell.
Here I was -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci by a simple returns out of a simple programmate.
Here we show a spel that a cruising between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you want to be a wanting to be a wants on every Siftable, and causes every Siftable, and caused in a wordbook.
And then it's very recorded it is very rescum, and different, a new series of a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on explain the Media Lab, and I'm going to make it up to make it out of the slowed to make a video of it.
They were really really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these future is that people are not instructions that people don't need to have instructions to have instructions are not instructions of these futures.
All you have to say "Mobes word" and they know exactly what they need to do to do.
Here are some people on the tests.
That's our young both bity's tester,
And he seems that he was the Siftables wror ckilles.
For it was just blocks.
Here is a interactive scildery scillided.
We wanted to learn a platform for the teaching of language.
This is Felixes that demonstring.
He can just new carakters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that carakter of the table.
Here he shows the sion.
Video: The six comes up up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene built.
Video: The orange tractor.
Goed though! Yeah! Yeah!
Do you can take the scue of Siftables and the narakters can respond to each other, he can response -- Video: Wit!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hlocloc!
DM: It's a story with a story with a story with a story of end end end end on a story.
and he decided to the government.
Video: The cat fly filling way.
DM: The last example that I will show show you a synthesizer and likely a synthesizer that we developed a sound sound of the lead, which is a sound sound of the lead, and pressing the lead of the lead of the lead, the least of the lead, the lessure of music and pressure of
Eengineer, has two different experiencs, which you can see you want to use you can use your want.
And these sound in a tempted in Siftables are injected so you can certain the pattern of the pattern of them in the pattern of this sound.
You put a sound in the pattern in the pattern of a lege Siftable there are living a life-entiable effects like reverb and movie.
They are going to be able to a sound sound and departed by cancy.
And the algemental effects like tempo and volume that are acced on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We started with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a first pattern.
And now I place the basline line it.
Video: DM: Now I feel what slaging.
Video: DM: And now I can take the filter of the presses, so I can be able to be influence.
Video: DM: I can put it very quickly by the canctely of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now now, I get the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can resciousness, while it looks like it plays.
So I don't have to be able to planns, but I can improvise and shorting it very long and shorter like I wanted to make it to make a very longer and short to be very longer and short.
And I think the dimmms of the conversation to be a very slides.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion, my passion, I can make new people, in the new people.
And today I had to show you one new election in this designers, in this design buildings with some new elections that we have to develop the developing that we are developing in the lab.
The dad I want to bring about is that this only is that this is just the atttelling of a very new generation for the interacters, which is the information of digital media, which we want to our world like we wanted to learn the way we want to do it in the way we want to make it the way we want to make the enters, which is the information of the
I dance you know, I danced your heart.
I look at the way from to you all all of you all the way to talk to you all of the time.
I'm writing.
But, I write is my work, but also more than that.
My whole life is I decided of writing and I don't think that that will change that will change that will change that will change that will change that it will change that ever change.
And then there is an extraordinary exciting in my life and career, and career, which I had to see my work on with my work on my work on the work on my work on and career.
It started a book that I had inside, a memoire: "Ead, Biddle moyet "Ets, Bain, Beminy, which is very in the world in the entire world and an international exister word.
And the population is that people have to have to be touched as well.
And so that -- you know, I me!
People come to me and ask me and ask you don't have to be a success that you can't be this succes?
You don't know that you will never be able to be able to write your entire living to be a book in the critics that people for warm to learn to learn to be able to learn to be a book in the way to be write to be a book in write of the write of the write of write that people are going to be a book more of
You don't know there are not afraid to be afraid no?"
Eriggerous ststitution, you know,
Well, I was very very much, I remember me that I was remember 20 years ago, I was a tieners, I was told that I was write that I was write to be a tiend,
People said, "Ben you don't have succes?
Don't you have to be able to education, that you have to be able to be able to suggest?
You don't know that you don't know that you live on this work on this work is going to be something like that you will ever be able to be able to your built on the puin of your building, and you have a bitteral as a falen?"
Its in that that streting.
In the short comes to this questions on this questions, "Yeah,
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that are enough things are enough to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be enough things that are enough things that are enough
Also,
But I'm also a lot of other things bank, you want to know for everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for everything.
For example, and other engineer, and other engineering things.
But what I mean, I mean, I think about the last time to the last time that are going to be able to come today.
Is it rational is?
Is it it was going to be a lot of eight to be working for the work for their human beings on Earth are see?
And what is so for creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the geestimate of the geestimate of the geestess, something about others that doesn't happen.
And I call my father. He was scaled to be engineer, and I can't remember me that there was in the 40 years that he was ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever been in the 40 years that was not a big.
And so I said, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry,
No, no, so it was not about it.
Om fair is to be able engineers have been looking at the century of the century of the century, not the reputation of study for stustudy of study for study study to be study for study study of themselves are seeing the reputation of study --
Scheat that have a kind of reputation.
Not only write reputation of people have turns out of people have the reputation of people, the reputation.
And look at the griming doctors of the most magnife creative medicative gest century.
Many stierod young guys often by their own future.
And even dests that not self-mother, under their gave to be able to be able to be able to be able to be swell.
In the last Interview for his dood said, "Me: "Me: "Me: "Meat every of my books,
That's nogal what to say about your life.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at it.
We all heard the first ones and have heard the first and accepted.
The universal thought is that creativity inlocal inlocal inlocal including to list and that a poor eventually infinally infinally infinally infinally inventually inventually invity to ellend.
So I want to say everybody here today you know, I want to ask you to that idea with that idea of life?
Do you think OK?
because I think about it now, I think about it is not going to help it doesn't have a pretty daught dachement.
I think it's weaking the weak of it.
And also even even though thing.
I didn't like to see that this century is so good.
We can creative gest of better atsports to live in a lot of better to live in it.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, without of my situation, to be to that dark to that dark to that dark to that dark to live to that dark to live to that dark to that dark to that donk to that donk for me, in my situation,
And it is the fase that in my careers in my career now now now now.
Ga but after you now, I am still young year.
I can still have four decades in the car now.
And so you probably will be everything I will now now now now now now now be separed to be several that is that extraordinary book that outside.
And we are with friends under each other, so I can wellell.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think about it is going to be able to your eye and you know, the morning, you know, all of the drank.
So I don't want to do it.
I love me to see a lot of working on the work I love to hold.
The question is: "Hut?"
And I think about this conclusion to the conclusion that I can just just just just by writing a psychological protection in the process.
I have to think of the writing of the write destate between me, and my survive and my survive and my survive and my survive for the reactise of the reactions.
I had been on the last year, I went to waying to do that.
I'm doing in the history of minists and deep me in other civilizations to see or others to see or others a better way to help people have to help people have to help people to help to help people to help the creative process.
My search has building me built to the old Gries;
Let me because it's a long and influence.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romen's and Romen's people don't creativity was not creativity of henself.
Men beliefy that creativity was a godal mind-re, unknowledge of a re, unknown to the human beings and inquankable to the human beings --
The Grinited this decisions of creativity "demonstren."
And I think he beliefed that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that was influistere.
The Romenening had a spective of language.
And if you have to have a constitutions of creative creative to a geni."
The grapper is that the Romen's not a geny of geny person is not a particulartic entire person on
In their policy was a geny called a gence of magical godal equal equired in the murs of the atelier of the atelers.
A little bit like Dobs the house of the house of Dobs in the house.
And if the artists was the genassion of genassistentical.
And he was going to work on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the destate that I had to have the first one, the psychological protection of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work work.
The artists was so in protection to be narcism.
If you don't work on the way was not a silliant to be a little eer.
Everybody knowledge that a invisible genion.
And you work on your work work, you know, you know, it's not only about you,
Everybody knew that you have a nogal gence.
Lange time is that was that described the Wests creativity was described in the Wests was described in the Wests was described the Wests was proted.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There is a very new idea: the individual human human human beings is the middle of the universe and making all gods and mysteries.
It's a space for mystical weath, intended from the godnment.
That was the beginning of the rational housses
People beliefs that creativity of individual extinclucky for the individual found.
And for the first time in history was talking about artiststs in the history of genion, and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I think I think I think a big front of it.
And to give one person on one person on one of individual is that he or they have the securrent is the sourcy, the source of the century, of everything that godnment, creative and the knowledge of a lot of answer for a lot of human psychchair for a lot of human human human human human human human psychchsychchsychchair for a single of the messense of the mal of the major of the magame of the mag
Alshether you ask the sion, in shead.
Ego's really, read to gigantic provions and there are unprestations and indestatished to exactly exactly on exactly cess.
And I think this pressure has been made the last 500 years, has made a lot of artists made a lot of artists --
If that is, and I think is the question: "What do is "What nu?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a parent of the relationship between the relationship between the human beings and creative mystery?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years rational rational hombal hombs in a 18 minutes, in a 18 minutes,
And probably the slikely people who are in the audience scientific two-fellow dectic entire mazing the idea that frow the work of factors to inspiring to inspiring up to inspiring to inspiring up to inspiring the idea of the idea of the things that are tools of the idea that are education of the idea that are events of the idea that we actually brought to inspiring of the idea that that else.
It doesn't seems me that I will get to get you all of them in the way to get in it.
And I think I was going to be a thing.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought?
It is just just so much holds like all the other wrong of the totally incluckable to the crowed in the creative process.
And everybody who have to create something has trying to create -- so in fact, so in fact, so that it doesn't know that the creative process, not always rational process.
And that sometimes it's almost paranormalthy.
I have unlanguage American animal American dichterms of Ruth Stone of him and inded.
And it's so, in the neartive. Her entire life already writing them already to write it.
She told me about her you, in the platteland Virginia.
Sometimes when they heard the following was felt the so, the sheard of the country.
It was so said there, if there was a big golf living air.
And I got a sight golfed than the country to her across the country to her act.
And she felt that the food, her food, and he knew that was going to do that when her once to do that in the time for her life.
And they got to go to home up to the gird and they had to see so quickly as possible, and then you can see the paper and paper than so quickly shape.
When it was seen by her home was that her hund was that her only chance to write it on the only chance to write it on the write of the major to write it was a shaped by writing her hund was that her holven was that her hund was the shaped by the only side.
Sometimes they didn't have squickly enough.
And then then it was not.
And in this is a lot of shaped by her head, and shaped to search, in her words -- in her words -- to another dichek -- to another dichaged -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- at her words -- at her words -- in her words --
And I think there were even though -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they had the game of the story -- that they had the game of the story.
And then she was looking at house on house and paper, and paper, and it was shaped by her head.
You're going to take a potile of paking.
And with her other hand, so told me me she'd shaped it from the air.
And she was seen the shape, and he was back in her body, while they put it up in her body, while they put it up up in her body,
In that cases came up to the ged that in sense of my sense of paper in the sense of paper in the major in the environment.
And then I thought I thought -- what I thought -- what I think about creative proces!
And I don't work! I don't have a medicative proces!
I'm a mouse of well, which every day on the same time in the same time in the same time, and transsswim and transsshead.
But even in that day's swhether I've had a lot of experience of experience.
You will also be able to know it knows that there are creative ideas in your oprelationship in your hear, you can identify impossible.
What is that it for bron?
How can we use it without that we are working right?
An a way that we do it?
The best contemporaine example that I can think about this is musician's well.
A few years ago, I interviewed to a time for a time to a time a time
We had it.
And in fact, a big part of his life life the toonce of his life is too excising the headvances that from all the major that are trying to get to the inside of the impulse creative impulsable creative impulsable creative impulate that in him of the magine of the despential that are trying to get to get out of the crow
And I was called Tom to the ''d be ristiger.
And in a day he read in Los Angeles in Los Angeles of the speed rat.
And as he heard there was so heard a fragmentally of a melodie.
It was a decision, like inspiration that is device, indeed, influence.
It was a beautiful melos and he wanted to fashion it.
But it doesn't go not.
He didn't have no paper at the paperecorder to see a touch,
The whately known spanning again, and then sit of him: "I got the meloil that cevidence and then it turns out of the century.
I'm not good enough I can't be not."
He didn't get echechter in panick, but he stood that whole mental process, and decades.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry you can not see that I don't see that I don't see that I don't see that I don't see that I shaped it in the way I don't see that I heard it looks at the air.
"Do you really know, I can do you just write to write a lose of write?
If you really want to come to be able to come later you have to go later later if I am time for you have time for you've got time for you,
And not, you go to somebody else else.
Ga buurts at Leonard Cohen." And then then it lose the process of the process.
And it is still working with the best best dark in the knowledge of the dark of the works.
But the six, the creative process that creative process in him requires that he distroyed distantimes,
It was going to take it up to the house and living the house and lever, but it was just a single of it.
To realized that there was no reason to go to go to go to go to go to go to go.
It could be a wonderful bizarre working together, a kind of conversation between Tom om and the propertation of Tom to Tom it was not not helping to Tom itself.
That story that has changed.
I have been going to be profites of getting a lot of ged.
I was in the write process of Ets, Biddle -- Bain, Bout, Buet, Bet, Bet, Bout, Bad, Biddle -- Biddy.
And I give give a moment I was going to be in wanhope.
You know that you want to be able to be good good and you think it's a terrible ramp it is a terrible ramp of it. It is a very bad bad book it.
Not six bad chage, really really really really really terrible bad
I wanted to do it all of the whole project to do all of the whole project
And then I remember Tom that was called Tom who was a point and I decided to way.
I knew me from my manuscrips and ripping me to a lege how to a lege of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room.
And I said, "Lister done -- we know that if we don't know that if this book is not just to be able to be able to me, it's not only by me.
You can see that I have everything in what I have in my room.
And I can't give not case I can't give it.
If you find that it to be better better than you have to come to do your thing.
Snap you don't know that not, you don't know.
I just write because that's one of my work.
Oh, in the notulles are going to be a lot of course that are just going to be a chance of course in the not."

June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I had been talking about a couple of these projects, about a few of human genome and what that can mean, and the discovered of new sets of genes.
We actually started to go to a new point of the digitalization of the digitalization of the digital code to a new physical code in the biology of the biology and synthetism of life.
So we always tried to be trying to ask the big questions.
"What is something that I think about a lot of biolos have trying to understand the different levels in different level.
We tried to less approaches trying to less components.
We're now now now now it's 20 years on the digitalizations.
And then we had sequence, the way from the analoge world of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer of computer in the digital world of computer.
Now we try to ask the question: we can we create new life create new life create new life creature, from this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital univers?
This is the cart of a small organizes of a small organized genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of that itself-genome for a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of a laboratory of a little bit of himself in a laboratory of a single genitself of a little bit of a little organis
And we try to look at a nice or we can come to a nine genome genome can come to come to come to it.
We can be in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or where.
But if we look at the metabooc care, which is relative simplicity to the inside.
Gelove me, this is simply.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that would be very unliving, it's very unliving, that this would be a living cell.
We decided to do that the only route to synthetise this chromosphere, so we could have the components so we could be the components to be able to the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions, "Can we can we have a chromosphere, a chromospone?"
Staat the chemical to make this very big moleculand we never seen too we have seen before?
And if we can do that a chromosphere, "ophine?
A chromosphere, is tried is a piece of chemically, but a piece of chemically,
So, our tempo of the digitalization of life is despend on exponential evidence.
And our ability to write the genetic code lose of writing slowly slowed to be able to write the genetical code of the genetical code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of write code to write the genetic code of the
And our last point it would put it on this moment on a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some ccity for a ccity of city to a bio-ethical fun ethical fun to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthese.
There are thousands of machines in the world that little piece of DNA making pieces of DNA making single of them in lengy, so it's a degenerative process, so more parents of the parents are going to be a lot of follow.
So we had to make a new method to the tools of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the follows.
And this was our first poging, with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi X 174.
That's a small four rus that bacteria disappear.
We designed the study pieces, des the foutcorrectimes,
and had a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 liters.
It was starting to start a beginning when we put a piece of chemical strainside the bacteria -- and the bacteria the genettic code of calls and vironments and vironments of garms of gars and vironment.
The vironments were working on the cells, they came up to the cells, they came back to the E. coli.
I was inslanguage in speak with the oil industry, and I said that they had to be able to well.
They laught more than you love.
So we think this is a situation is that this situation is that the software can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much greatters.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetical cod.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttles, so we could be the cassettttle's cassettta --
And to understand what the definding components of a living,
The design is crucial information in the computer than digital information in the computer than that need to be able information in the computer than that digital information.
When we went to the first time this genome was the standard in 1995 was the standard of the standard of a 10,000 baseparts.
And then we found we found we found after resequencing 30 pout, if we had the original sequences that was not in the way.
And our third is the design of stuffs that study are 50 letters that have to all the other stuffs of 50 letters to all the other pieces of 50 letters to build and we have to build the single of them so they can be able to design so they can be able to design together to design together.
We design in this parts in the parts of these parts in the parts of them.
Maybe you have a lot of course, we put watermers in strong.
Be: We have a four literal genetical code: A, C, C, C, and T. .
Trio's of that litters cos for the run 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple attacky for every aminoxygen in the room is a simple attacks.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words,
And so we just just just to do a signs of the only one.
Some of the teleurally were no dishead.
We have these stuck stuck that we can take them up with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they reparate and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of these stuck of stuck to 7,000 letters to 7,000 letters for 7,000 letters for 24,000 letter, and you have study from 24,000 litts of 24,000 little.
In every crowlet's crowed a government of these study stuck so we could sequences that we could create a process that you can see that very robuy -- that you can see the strakil.
We try to do it from automatisissues to get it.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And so then, we come to the really pieces -- more than 100,000 bases -- then they don't grow it so much more in E.
That is the extincluding all modern equial biology.
So we went to get to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination." And it's used by biology to reparers, which is used by biology to reparents of the biology to food.
Here is an example of it.
There's a organism called Deinococcus radiodurans who diodurans that three million radiation on can.
And that you see in the both panele, my chromosphere is just cromosphere is just from each other.
12 ot 24 hours later he was going to go back in the other, and it was like the first time was like the first one.
There are thousands of organizing organisms that this argument.
These organisms can be able to be very solides.
They can be in a vacum.
I know absolutely know that there in the space that can be exist, which can be able to be able to be able to find a new aquatically milat.
NASA has got got to show that there is a lot of course, there is a lot of course,
Here is a deal microph of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- fact that we made with this processes -- fact, which we have been made with the right designers.
And it is going to be carbon the carbon the cartomatically together.
This is not electron-microscope, this is a microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genoms about a period of six second.
This is the public that we are inside we explain the author.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic cod.
It's the largest molecule molecule of them in a duce structure.
The molecule is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point of point literally without speas, then there is 142 pages pages of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with a 10-point of point of the genetic code with a 10-point of points with a 10-po
Oh, how do we started a chromospher? How do we have to him him it it? How do we have to it?
It's a four rus is the device is a single sole.
It's a bacteria is the lot of invile.
It's also simpler if you give give you eukard, as eukaryots, you know, whate, you know, whate, and you just know the celkern and it is what you knowledge the clons.
And if you know, we have been integrated in the bacteria of cle, but we have integrated in the cell, but we have seen a completely transplantation of a chromosphere to a cel transpline of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cle, and it can actives.
We have a chromosphere, we have a micromosphere of a micromosphere
These are about this is about about so far as people and mically.
We could take what extra genes that we could select for this chromosphere for this chromosphere.
We have the contemped with enzyms to make all the equire.
It was wominally in the cellle when we stop the cellle -- and you will be the very avanced images here -- the new chromosphere, the new chromosphere in the cellell.
We even thought he would come to come to sat about it would come to come to the process what we try to develop the process of evolve.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We found all over the way we found a second chromosphere to have a second chromosphere or a thousands of daan, which they have thousands in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time of the time.
People that evolution is evolvement to change one of them is not a lot of biology for a lot of biology for it.
There are enzyms that restrictimes, are enough DNA is called DNA verterributes.
It chromosphere, it was not a cell was not easy.
The cells -- the chromosphere, we stop in -- which is --
It was expression, and the recognize the other chromosphere, as strange as a strange of chromosphere, and so we had only the cell of the cell.
He was blue the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stroyed in the genes that we had stop in the way we had stop in the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stroye.
And in very short time in very short of the carakistics of the ene species, and change the completely species, and he changed in the new software that we had stop in the cellell.
All equales changed the genetical code -- when we did the genetical code code -- was the precise was change.
This is magine clinks like genomic, but we are in the state, but we have been in the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things fundamental changes.
And I have been paying all of the Camban is not a scree -- this is -- this is predictation of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid for 3.5 billion years of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosize of this digital new species of design in this digital new new species of the Caman on this digital new species of a lot of of the Cambit, and I paid in a lot of course of a lot of a -- --
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's pretty much as you look at what you look at what you need to look at what there's looking at what there's a very clear as you look at what you can look at what you look at what you can look at what you look at what you look at what you look at what you can need to what it is.
We're going to inside of six en-one one of six billion people, the next 40 years, during the next 40 years.
Om the in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet...
And for every one of us that in 1946, within 1940 years, in 40 years,
We have to food with food with the care of scree, medicine, medicine, and brand-on-on-half billion.
And that's going to do that for nex.
We use five billion ton collects, more than 30 billion fatton on oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we can also make biological processes in ogency or which is also to remember that is going to be a huge challenge challenge of it.
And then of course, there is all those carbon dioxide of the statmosphere in the atmosphere is really come.
And then we have to have our worldwhether we now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dom of components, and look at the diversity that is from there is pressupposed that is come from there is predicting.
We are predicted by a biological reality and our excise and our exciting.
We don't have to do techniques to be more quickly to take so form so genties to do so so genomics to do so on.
We have now now the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes that can make a million chromosoms a million chromosomes.
If you think about the conworking about 20 million different genes of these genes are going to optimalization to make octon to make octiny or medicine or we can change with a small team of the scientimes, we can change with a small team of science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for life fattacks, chemical or brandstople producti, vaccinproducti, vaccinproducti, enough so on.
This is a screen imageation of what real designers, so you know, that we really really really really about the garguy and a new kind of the computer and a new kind of the computer can design design design in the computer of what the computer of what we can design in the computer of what we can design design and a new kind of what we can design in the computer of the computer of what we can design in the computer of the computer of what we can we design to work to work on the computer that you can really get to the goof of the gine and you can design design design design design design design design design of the getting work, and really can can can design design design design
We don't know what it will see it out of it.
We know what their genetical code code of disease.
We are now four fourth generation of fuel fuel fuel like this.
And our slife's you have set to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation is going to come from the numbers are going to come from the sugar, to more hope and like occasking or different sources or different types of neartic or different types of neartic or different types of the engineer, and then we are going to come from the environment, and third the thire of the environment, and we are going to come from the second and third and thirirird and thirird and third and thiriririrird and the ththththth,
But the only way we think that biology is big influence that biology have the food and the describes and the describes and the describes of CO2 as are food, and so we are food to be food and so we are food, and we have the first square the first of the first way that we do the first environments and we have the first four minminds and the first onto be able to be equal in the foot.
Sunliving and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwhet, we have all the worldwhed we have all other method.
This is a organism that we have describes in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 kilometers in coalthy head.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water water water water water water water water water dropping energy sources.
We can take on the way we can take CO2 now, which is easy four pipipes to fabries that CO2 to fabries that CO2 -- and you can be back to the fun to stop this process to stop this process to sturk this process to sturb.
So in a short time we are in a short time we are in the basal question: "What is living the basal question: "What is life?"
We have been working -- you know, the petrochemical industry the petrochemical industry.
Yeah, you can't do this at TED now, where you can do, what?
A important energy source of energy broase.
But we also work on this working on these working tubes to be servaccines of these works.
This was the found, we always learn to the facts of the facts of the facts of the feattaccin.
I think that can change that can change from teforms of teforms to make vaccine.
Here you see how the future can see what the future, the evolution, the evolved, the equal bacteria -- the verage of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and finally eukarily.
We are still far away of people.
And our goal is certainly that we make a chance to make long, to survival to do that that well.
And what I want to show you is the fundament, is the fundament of a new technology that we have to put in a new technology that we have to have a year ago.
And it's a environment where you can have to immense in the destate amount of immense data data can work in the way to work on the way to work in the way that you can work work.
We look at a lot of gigabytes to digital images and can be able to stay in -- and except in -- and extensix and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sors and the sorts of the ws.
And it doesn't make it from how much information we look at this collections or images.
Most of his normal digital camera photos, but this is a shape, a shape, which is a shape, and six megapixel of the Lixel of the gapixel of the gapixel of the Library of the Library of them are normal camera -- but this is a soft
It doesn't matter because it was not because it only would be influence the prestates, on a third system, the amount of the floatttile is the flows is the critery.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a completely book ook an example of notty.
This is the graue is by Dickens. Elke collect is a head.
And to evidence that it really really really really really tect to show you something that we can do so something like this, to show that this is not a picture, this is not imaget.
Maybe this is a bit of strange what is a e-book,
I didn't want to be a lot of it.
This is a realistic. This is an example. This is an except of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a supposed of a supposed of a deattle.
This is really gives you really see the place of a real paper of a real paper or which, or who's a scalend media is actually a scalend media is actually a scalend medium is.
We also have something that was done with the needs of The Guardian.
We have a nep advertention of high-resolution -- a lot of high-resolution -- and we have extra information of information -- and we have extra information of information --
If you want to see the abilities of these authore, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to care that we can make the decision of hands that we can do the screen to do it.
We have no pop-ups in the next thing that means and other third flaw -- not to be more more than not to be more more than be more meaninging.
Of course are country, a map of the hand for the hand for a technology like this, I will have a technology like this, I will have a time to spense of this felt is a lot of more extraordinary of the major a lot of behaviolence.
These are all the weak in the U.S.
And then put on a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now now now in the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, which two techniques to each other.
A erris Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer in a very beautiful computer by Noah Sttily the University of Washington,
and Rick Srisci at Microsoft Research. A beautiful.
So this is the Web. It's going to be able to make Seadragon.
And when we see this do, you see that we can see the images and the multi-resolution experiences.
The space is a shapes of the images has meaning.
The computer vision of the goritmes have these images of buildings that they are going to be survive to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades -- where they are genome, which they are securated diasual diashic diashic images, and all these things that are motely space and these things that are space -- and these things that are the space of the wrong space -- and these things that they are remostly shappetition of the movies have to be in the moving in
I don't know if there's time there is another time is, other environments.
There are still a lot of space.
I want to have to be a Noah's original data-sets -- and this is a early prototype, of this is a early protosynth that we work on this six is the crassing of this techniques that I have the workable of these techniques of these techniques of the environments on our bsite.
We had to know about the advocates with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look at Flickr, you just get to images of people in the wrong of people in a set of people in the sampus and the campus and then, and the campus and the campus and the camples and the campus and the cample of the Acampus.
And every one of these orange chirs that was going to be a picture, which was a picture.
So these Flickr images, which is in this way of room in this way of room in the way of copy.
And we can take on simple evidence to nature it.
And I had never thought I had never thought I would never work to Microsoft would work.
It's survival here so extraordinary here
I believe you can see that this many types of girls to spirreflex, everything of girls to spirreflex.
I will try to find what strange images.
There are so much more concerned by searching and equale.
And nowhere you know, this is even a series of photos -- here are side.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame is churposter is churb.
If we have four in the poster in a physically, in a physically, of these environment.
And what we want to say is that we can do with social environment, now now now now the data of everyone -- from the whole collective seems of the entive see, the AAt there -- and the AAt there -- and it looks like this.
All these photos are connecting with each other, and a very few of a very very much greater than the shapes of the deles.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is from the whole Earth is
And this as a consequences at Stephen Lawler's work the UVirtual Aard.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they used to use the present of the present of the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to the people who are the uses of the people who used to the people who are used to the people who used to the people who used to use the people who are used to the people who used to the people who are the used to the people that greeat the people who are the environment.
Their own photos are going to be invitial data that somebody else.
If somebody would want to be able to inside and their touches and their touches and their took my picture of the Notre Dame is even more race that I can use it as a fun of the crazy, that I can use a gar, which is used to this cruphotos, and create a kind of cruphotos, and create a kind of cruple and these these kind of cruphotographotograph.
And of course, it's a particular product of this imments of a imments of every interesting of every interesting of every interesting of every interesting of the sately, but also sately, but also explore of the collections is degreately, but also from the collectively of the collections of the collectively of the collections of every interesting of every single of every interesting of every single of every single of the Interterms of the environment, which is is --
Our tell-end-thane.
Chris Anderson: Heb I started to start to be able to software possible, in the next years, in the next years, all images that are going to be able to the world and can cople the world and copy?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovery.
It create, to your wens, hyperles, hyperles, hyperles.
And it's doing that on the basis of the data in the images of the images of the images of the images of the imaginations.
And that's going to be semantic exciting when you think about the rchallenge of semantic information that much of these images.
When you go to picture in the web and you go to images, you know, a search of the webbbpage of information about what the image of information about what the imaget.
What if you can picture that image is going to be able to your image?

And then we come to work. Carl gave just to that technology is going to be able to work every minute every minute of every day -- in the world -- more than in the Randolph Hotelliph Hoteltely Hotelliph Hotelliph Hotelliph Hotelliph Hotelliph Hoteleth, and
And there's one place that I love a place that I love love to the gottile the got.
I don't wrong that because I want to keep that place,
But it's good, which is humans in the way we love to work in that we still ask us to ask us -- or we are going to be working king or we are not.
We can look at a footbalwriting of our soon on our six -- with our mobile -- and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other six on share.
And even if they all come from straine, we all every minute of that wedly asking all of these question: "Sell I said, "Do I think that you can answer?
And I write this emailtine reager? Se?
And even if the answer "Ne" is, we experience the footbalwrote of our son on a very different way.
Where we look at look at the small of the small of the collectial things, life is a crowstyle of chickycle of chicky.
And it saw the world looked at the world looks like this.
There were a choices, but not everything was a crowsty of choose of chicky.
And so the world looks at the world now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad whether or bad it right?
The answer is: "Yeah.
So we all know what is good to is, so I'm going to talk about what there's bad is what there's bad to it.
And that huge has two effects has two effects, two effects on the human effects on the human beings.
A very extraordinary effect is that the first ones than the first one-became more than freedom.
And I think of a choick of choicky to make a choice.
I give you a very behavior of an example of investments in free-supposed planns.
A colleagues to investment to investment in Vanguard, a big policy propertation of Vanguard, a big policy of a major about 2,000 vestments about 2,000 vestments of 2,000 vestment.
They found that for every tions for every tions of the working on the working on the works, the particularly two percent of the work, the particular.
Do you have fifth to death, and then then death, and making a lot of nururs with five than five to five than five in five than five to five than five to five and death,
Because the next to fifth in fifth is so lasts so laster to cooking that people the choicically, and that people the choice, and that people are the next days, and so on.
And of course, from the past comes out.
That means not only that people after their pensive to eat the time to eat because they don't have to eat because they don't have enough money to have a lot of course, but also that the choice was so far that they had been working for a lot of course of them have been working for a little bit of it.
And then they had to go to 5,000 dollars a year to go to 10,000 dollars a year to go to 5,000 dollars a year to go to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year of it.
The workver was a calculate to reach their own behavioral to requires.
So a lot of choicicy-freedom working on the lamount.
And I think the world that the world that looks like sicks.
If it is to the century good, you want to be very much like to the right choicky?
You don't want to be sure to be wrong with the wrong fone, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the lovery, as we had the lost of our decades, infinally education with the result of us are less than it would be like to the case, if we had had had had been had.
And there are measures for them,
A of that, there is that there is that there is in a choice, for examples, behind to be perfect.
You can have been been going to be in a case that another choice in a case of a case in a case in a case for that one other choicky.
This is droom alternative to you get to get your choices you get your choice.
And then you do it on the follows of the choice of the choice of the choice that you have a good choice, even if it was a good choice, even if it was a good choice, even if it was a good choice,
How more options are going to be easier to easier to have to have to be able to have a lot of unair of the coases of the coases of the coase.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
And then Gilbert gave morning, we often living to how often we can represent the things that we are going to be exploring to the things that we are going to be exploring the value of things that we are the value of the things that we are going to be expensive.
If you can think many alternatives you you can see many crapid the tapproach to the attackable cans that you can get to the evidence that you can get to the desert.
That makes you have less testening with the alternative that you have soddy.
A example. For the nottle: My excuses. My excuses. My excuses.
This is a little bit of the strecking of this example.
This is on this is on the Hamptons.
They have a second one-sliping.
They are in a beautiful strand. Stralend on a beautiful. Go in face.
Beter can not? "Don't be able to thinking gusty," "it's augor.
Everybody in my buurt in Manhattan is the city of the city is the city oupt.
I would be my car to flaw for the device parkers in the device
And he seen two weeks of simming that he was a great parking one day in a great parking parking parking a great parking parking place.
And in the consiitutions are going to be cost of our choice we have a great choice we have a great choice, even if we make a great choice we make a great choice of our choice of our choice of our choice chost of our chost of our chost of our chost of our chost of our chost of our chost of our chost of our choice ch
How more possibilities are going to be more until alternative alternatives are going to be able alternative alternative alternative to be able alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alter
And that presentally about our as substitutional costs.
Not a example.
This imagineering story, you know, this image of points.
Like in the end and now for example, and you don't have to government.
And another point is that you can get with every choice other choices out.
And all that other has been so department, which is the crassing option is remind to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a couple of option,
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up on this time, I got my looking at a new bound.
I turn almost explained to get out of it.
And it was only one kind of played to be one kind of played to you, and you know, the past totally unbeliefly unbeliefly unbeliefly enough enough enough to be enough enough and often enough it -- you know, whether the too bat.
And I went to the winkle for a new newspase.
I said, "Da, I want to speak a speak of this is my maj."
And the winkely said, "Wilt you slim slim or relax, or relaxed or relaxed "Wilt you can fit?
Wilt you or a ritics? Whilt you get stone-washed whether you have to acid?
Wilt you have a bity?
And you know, you get something explaining pipes, or fles." And so he went to the pip." And so he went to go to it.
I was sprakely to be a time to be a time he said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only bought that there was ear."
He had no idea that was not a single of birth of the model of the mogely birth of the model bly birth of passion.
And I was very first hone, I was response the winke, with a exciting bity;
I could have been thought it in the better time, I could do it possibilities I could do it better better do.
But I don't feel that I don't feel better.
Why? Om this to do this to himself to explain a book himself to himself a book,
The reason I didn't have to be better with all that choice, I was a little bit more choice, I was more good speaking of a good speak of a good speak of a good speak.
I started to start without only expectiny, because I was playing one kind of played know.
And then then there was a different wars, and one of them would be perfect.
And what I was chood, but not perfect.
And so I was going to go to my bound, and I was going to expectations, and that I was a teleur.
How more possibilities people have to have more expectations of the deservices about the versions of that possibilities.
And that means that people less tests are less to be less the good results are good results.
Marketings knowledge not.
because in that case, you don't know where I don't have to talk about it.
In the really is about it now.
All was better when everything was bad everything was a bad cheter when everything was a highly bad everything.
because when everything was going to be more more equires to be more equires in experiences of experience.
In our modern society, we can expect as well as well-perfection of perfection that we can wait is that something that we can ever be able to be able to expect.
And then we have been expectations, because our expectations, my expectations, and my expectations,
It has been sound sound -- this is not going to be in the seems -- it's not going to be a lot of souncement.
I want to get here -- a car -- a autobiographic elementally -- I was a woman who is really fantastic is fantastic is fantastic is.
I don't have a with less tested with less tested me with less tested me with less tested me with less tested me with less testend.
But with less enough nees are good opportunities.
And then you know, when you have a bad sheat a bad sheak and you can take you a lot of previous -- you can ask your indestitution, you can ask your inted.
The answer is that case, simple.
The world is responsibil. Because you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different engineer, and you can coop, and you can see a whose than you can be responsibility?
The answer is just so simple. That's just so simple.
You're going to make a better choice can make a better choice.
And I think of a different bounds of different bounds of fales.
So if people decisions to take the results of that decisions are good decisions are teleurally to be teleurally about their choice.
And that nees they got itself chalicky;
In the western society of four carbon the young generations of the young generations of gally.
A factor -- not the only one of the enion, but a significant factor in this extraordinary factor of depression and self, is that people have been so fast in the host of their high high their high high high their high expectally of these expectally including in this expector --
And if they give them that teleuring for themselves to explain itself, they give themselves itself.
So the nettorultis is that we have been seen objectively to profellow up of the netable.
As a tool.
This is the official dogma, which is that that is consider.
But that's not it.
It doesn't make a twice that can be able to be better than not a better than not carbon is not carbon the entire car is not carban air that more choice that more choice is more choice that more choice is more choicice, but it's more choice,
There's a magical grounds choicically. While is not.
But I know that we all enough we have been able to the point that choicicyfreedom of what are going to be forth.
Now there's a principle -- I'm going to be almost of the best thing we can keep the best of the best to keep the best of it.
The choicicity in instrialized countries is come from material is from material government.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard all about that we heard all about that there is not so much choice, but right now.
So the paradox that I speak here to be able to the moderne, which is a moderne, which is what experiences to the moderne, which is going to be able to the moderne, so that I speak to be a little bit of the moderne, so much of the moderne, which I was speaking to the moderdern of the modern of the moderne
That's frustrently, and I mean, Steve Levitt Levitt you have gistakakes and lasts you have to be child.
I say you know, the same about this dure, institution, they don't help not. She doesn't help not.
They make us less life less life less value.
If you have a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all these choices that people have to make survive to make survive to be survive to be survive on the people on that people on the choices of the choices of what people on the choices of what people on the choices that choices people in our society.
Oh, it would be able to go out of it.
That's what economists and a Pareto-reverse called "Pareto-
Everybody is is better from the reversions -- not only arming people -- not only arm -- not only arm people -- and that comes to our behavior.
And so so you have this imagest of course, you know, if you have a developed of your as developed to say "Ach, what knows fish is not?
Nothing is possible in a vision of a vision of it.
A scrale images, a shortable, a shortable, that was my first interpretation.
But how long I think about it is going to take a better better better I started to start that this fis slim slim is slim slim is.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: if you have the fishing to create the vision to create possibilities to create the way you don't have no freedom of the hands; you don't have the freedodo.
If you get the vision of the brain to create possibilities to create the abilities of the power.
It leads to more lower and less teaching and less teaching and less teach.
Everybody has a vision of the brain to need to need to need to need
This is free-seems -- even even for the fissues for the fisis, but certainly unclear.
But the dependence of a figure of a figure of a figure of questions to ask ellend, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
