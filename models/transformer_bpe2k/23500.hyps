Last year I showed these two slides to show that the pool, which was the pool, who had about three million years of the size of the United States with 40 percent of the United States with 40 percent of the United States was 40 percent of the United States was was about 40 percent of the United States was about a pool,
But this particular problem because it doesn't show the nst of this specific problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the proble
The ice heap on the North Pole, in a sense of the sheart of our global climate system.
It set out in the winter and crazy.
The next slide that I show is a accelated version of what happened is happening in the last 25 years is happened in the last 25 years is happened in the last 25 years is happened in the last 25 years is happened to be a accelerated version of what happened is happening in the last 25 years is happened version of what happened is happened to be a accelerated version of what happened the next s
The permanently is red.
As you see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the year, it's the year, and the winter.
And the summer in the summer of the summer.
The so-called paintings, five years or older, is almost like flower, that from the body is that from the body is solid here.
In 25 years is the way this is to this one.
And that's a problem because the frozen founds around the North Icare heart and there are a very big amount of frozen woman, and there's a very big amount of woman, when it was mething, by microbes in methane.
Commouth of the total amount of distant in the atmosphere, that could be double that could be double as we reduce the connection point.
In some indeep muring in Alaska sign religion of methane in the water.
After the last winter went Professor Ky: Seit of Alaska with a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different deep there.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question or we will be that well.
A reason for that, this enormous "warm-bron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melectwaterriver two-aterriver two.
The water-volume is bigger than easy it is bigger than evolved it.
This is the Kangerlussian re-suaa river in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea soads because it is the landy because it is the place where it is the place where it is in the sea way it comes in the sea --
These stromings are taking flight.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, is the biggest ice ice ice ice ice mass on ice the Earth.
And the last month, reported scientists that the whole continent now, has a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly to the South Pole, with a few underwaters.
The whole continent is to six feet sea singer sea singer seeing stying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two of ice ice ice ice ice ice ice now, that a few years ago, who were still gletsjas.
40 percent of the world's population gets the help of his dress-water water of that meltic timelts.
In the Andes, this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more stros.
But when they disappearing water.
In California was there of 40 percent in the snovation of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoices reservoice.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions are going to be going to be read to it.
This global dream of drieving a dramatic styer of bos-burning.
And the number of natural reads around the world is spent with an incredible and never see face and never see face speed.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the 75 years.
This pattern is completely unpreservent is completely unpreservation.
If you look at it from a historic context of a historic context what happens.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 tons of CO2 hours.
25 miles in our oceans, every day in our oceans, look at the east area of the Stille of America, away, and on every single single sile of Indian subcontinent, there's a behavior of Indian expensive dalation.
The only big cause of the Earth, the only size of the Earth, next to the earth, which is the fires of fossil fuels of fossil fuels of fossil fuels of fossil fuels of fiels.
Olie is a problem, and steench, and steenk is the most problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extaces with China.
And there was a proposal to build more coal-carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon centers.
But we see a commace.
These are the coales of which the biting of the biting of the biting years and where green alternatives were forgetting alternatives were forgetting forget forget forget forget forged in the last years,
There's a political streeding of the gestuff in our country.
The urban carbon and oil industry gave industry gave 250 million dollars to promote coal coal coal coal coal coal of the operation.
And that was doing something something called me thinking about something
And the Churnantor in Tennessee, about four billion literally crops of the coal models model.
You probably seen it in the news.
This is the one after one after one after the biggest way.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooking linked around the Kerst cooolined was thrown around the Kersts was thise.
Video: ""Frosty the coal is a key of the coal-carbon man.
He's a consider to be in America, and he cares in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coal carbon man is becoming a day with the day of the day.
He's paid and employees and employees to keep their job."
Here's a big part of the coal of the coal in West Virginia frate.
The biggest mineral miness, the great bones of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, Harry Rey, they don't know what they talk abou."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimatch for Klimatching two campaigns on the eight.
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Video "Be COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threats for our things.
That's why it is why it is the most important goal is to give a giant engaging to the light to the light and bring the light and the regularly of the truth of the truth of value carbon the board.
Feit is, stead, not crazy.
We find that it is a solid -- and it still read -- and it still seem.
So, you don't make worry about climate change --
Let me just talk about us.
Video: Acteur: Schone of coal, you have heard a lot of it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shows of these hyper-carbon carbon carbon carbon centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are making pretty much a lay thing else.
But that's the sound of a coal technology.
And despite the fact that the branch of steenable one of the most important causes of the main causes of the Earth is changing the Earth is changing the support of technology that you see here.
Look at the time this is the shows of technology of technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative security.
Video: Sta: America wrong in crisis, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire with all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels like vuile collapsing and healthy and healthy oil.
But there's a new solution of it is a new solution to get out of this.
Forth America 100 percent of a 100 percent of sokay, within 10 years.
A plan to get to the work to work on the work to get a plan that makes us safer and the operate of the Earth opportunity.
And in fact, a solution that respective is to solve our problems.
Repower America. On the bottape of the one.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: It's Stem: It's about the energy.
One of the speech ways to make an endless of our dependence of old fuels that our planet fuels that our planet to help our planet fuelels that help.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, and sun, a new energy system.
Man people are about 2: Nieug investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African an's speaking: "If you want to be all to be soon everyone.
If you want to go far far far up."
We have to go far far.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called a update about an update about how that machine works.
So here I am here is the ones who don't waren: the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever taken at the enternal experiment ever taken in the bomb.
It has to be the circumstances that were able to get less than a billions of second after the universe started to 600 million times a second after 600 million million times a second.
Enorm ambitious, so.
This is the machine under Genene;
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one where I work. It called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in ath to the scale.
And at 10 september shaped the machine for the first time we were going to get the machine.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That carried in the control room.
It's a picture of the first partnesstraight that all around the LHC was going to go around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which was where in the detector in the detector flow up in the detector flow up with a bunch of the LHC, which was a photograph of the LHC, which was a p
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine, which is a huge overcome a huge over.
I don't know if this is got the biggest across or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we made a scientific as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had this golden behaviors.
These behaviors ago, 13 thousand of a bunch of power.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's too small behavior."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superago,
So on min 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can reach the behaviors that can reach that flow up with the behavior.
In one of the connections between the nine of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive away in the LHC, was a constructive of the constructive of the constructive of the constructive of the square.
It was the wireled something warmer, and it was intended to that 13 thousand of them was 13 thousand of a thousand of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a bird of a bunch of a thousand of a birth.
This was the result.
This is still more impressive if you realize that that that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of the weather than 20 centimeters.
We were about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did we do.
We all have repared them all reparts.
Now they're back on a road.
Eind murban the LHC will be intacks.
We will be able to put it back and we expect measures in juni, so that we can go out and look at the expect of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, have that unfortunces the debate re-incidents the value of scientific research for the scientific requency.
I think it's a really hard to be so hard is, the fact that we go beyond the things like the LHC.
I think the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to deal with the value of the value of the value of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Farato, this said, "Nsomething so dangerous Farato, this is that our images of science of scientist of scientist of science of science of science that there are not a new world's regaren't discuss in the natural world in the re, and that there are not a new world, and that there there are that there are not a lot of course of course of course of scienty, and that there are not a lot of course of course of course that there are that there are that there are not a lot of course of course that there are that there are that there are that there are
Thank!
I would like to start with you to ask back to your childhood time when you play with blocks.
When you found how to grab to grab them up, she picked up and conscious, you actually actually solve problems with learning and hands of space relationship of space relationship of space relationship of space relations.
And remainly insight is astrong is amazing of the world to understand the world to it.
If you can put information with an information by the physical interaction with objects -- and I was with objects -- with my advisur Pattion and my collaborator, Jeein of Kalanii -- what I started to ask -- what if we would use a computer to ask -- what if we would use a computer that moves on a plate of digital finger that moves on a plate of individual rebital with physical individual physical interacy with physical interacy of information with the information
and ordering the way we want?
And this question helped us so that we decided to look at an answer to build a response of Siftables.
Sort together is a Siftable computer of an interactive computer of a cottle-cottle.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel together their movement and they can get them to detecters and they have a screen and wireless and wirels and wirels and wirels and they can have a screen and they can be contain and they can have a screen and they can carry a screen and they can feel their movement and they can be move and they can be moved together and they can be put together and move them up, and they can be movevevement with the movement and they can be movement and put together and put together and then the hic.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands blocks can be moved by grabits, they can be moved by grab.
And the things that are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And this is that this aid tools have a more physical differentling of their movement and each other, and even from the way we move them from the way we move them are different new and nice interactions of interactions of the interactions of the way we have to discovery.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that is playing by the office plays and others and others playing others and others playing a cross-playing crosses.
These interactive portraits of interactive portraits of each other.
Indians next to each other, they will be put together together to each other.
If they get surround, they also noticed this and can be a little neroway.
and they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of everyday areas is the use of the color as it was a low-balance color as it was a low-of.
In this example, three Sifttles, and I can use them to go and I can use them to go color in a lider in a lives, where they become a living.
If we have over the same time, we went back a little bit back.
There are some of a couple of the education, especially played with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility and logic, and the result of the result immediately seeing things quivalent to see the result of the immediately good.
Here's a show show here is the development of a Fibonacci running through a simple calcular programmate.
Here's a game that is a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the random, on every Siftable, and shaped words, and shaped words.
After about 30 seconds it's very rescue, and appeard, and appears a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I succeeded them to get it out.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed almost no instructions of the instructions of the most interesting thing of this applications.
Everything you have to say is "Move word" and they know exactly what to do.
Here's some other people test the other people test it.
That's our botta tester, right at the right bottta tester, right-high-stront.
And it turns out he only catching the Siftles.
For him this was only blocks.
Here's an interactive paintingly painted up.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language of language.
This is Felix that demonstrates.
He can bring new carakters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that character of the table.
Here's he let the sun coming.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good mind "Yeah!
And by Siftles, the shaptles, he can put the near places on the carakters with each other, and the nex--- Video: Wa!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decided to walk up.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music that we developed with a sound of sound as a sound produces a sound as the lead, bass and pressure pressure and pressure print.
Eenyyodd different variations, where you can choose what you want to use which you want.
These sounds can be in a lege Siftles, so you can determined the pattern itself to determine.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way of a livable effects of a livable effects like reverb and filter.
They are being sound to a sound and proposed and protected by the office.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are taking the whole pattern.
Let's see one.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, length of a lead.
And now I put the basline.
Video: I add some some behind a little bit.
Video: And now I copy the filter of the filter on the presses, so I can affect the effect living.
Video: I can accelerating it by the offices by the offices of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now, I copy the filter on the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can reached the pattern of the pattern as it plays play.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything to be very longer and shorter as I want.
And finally the dimessages of the volume Siftable to the left Siftable to cover the left.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion out of passion from to the new people, my passion of the interfaces that are better interfaces in the way our brain and body work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in the design area with some opportunities that we develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is that this is just the attacks to a very new generation of helping media, which bring the information with digital media, which bring the information of our world as we want.
I thank you of hard.
I look at them out to talk to you to all the time.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life long I've been asked with writing and I don't think that ever change.
And yet, there is something that happened in my life and careers in my life and career, and I had to see my work with my work with my work on my work on my work to be re-re-re-re-careered property of the work.
It started a book that I wrote ungas written a memoire: "E, Biddly, that very very contradiction to my first work on the whole world of work on the world and an international exister of international existence.
The consequence, people now have to have to be told me as if I do do do do the tom.
And I think that -- gets me!
People come to me and ask ask to me and ask you you not get this success, you don't have to equar?
Don't you get to write your entire life will not be writing a book that people will write to the people are going to walk in warm that people will walk to write for warm.
Don't you get to this?"
And I think that you know.
Of course, that would be very very much, I remember that I was a teenager, I was when I was a teenager, I was telling that I wanted to be writing.
People said, "Do you don't get succes?
Don't you get to deal of point that you will go to supposed to the connect of it.
Don't you get your life to this work is going to be able to be a way without there there is a lot of biterats on the puin of your broken dreams with your bitter's bitter's sing?"
Something in that streting.
In the questions of my answer to ask on this novel, "Ja."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called called the things that are called called the things that are called called the things that are called called the things that are called called the things that are called the things that are called called the things that are called called the things that are called called
All of the time
But I am also a lot of other things job, you don't want to know what everything to everything.
For example, and other engine, and other engaged things.
But what I'm writing myself to write myself the last time when that come from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be focused for working to the work for the earth of the earth of his ge?
What is so particularly creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mindness, something that happens to be something to other, something that happens to other.
You can take my father. He was shoped engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years he worked on the 40 years he ever had ever asked to him or he was not afraid to him that was not afraid to be there for a follow.
And so of the way "Yeah, how is it with your chemistry?
No, so there was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been holding by the centuries of the centuries of not the reputation of manic-depressive alcoholists.
Scheating, who have a reputation.
Not only writers writers are also other creative people have been pretty instable, the reputation of the reputation of the instable.
And look at the grim death the most magic creative minds of the 20th century.
Many of stiered young by own stiered own.
And even those who don't have a suicide nurders, seem to be to be suicide to be able to be high.
In the last interview for his death said Mailer: "My each of my books is a piece of micrate of mice."
That's a little bit about to say about your life-work.
But of this kind of excrazy of this kind of excited.
We all have heard it before, and we have heard it with all the way and accepted it with all the time.
The supposed is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is to suffering and that an artist-existence, and that will lead to mission.
And so I want to ask everybody here today I ask you that idea life?
Find you that OK?
Because I'm thinking about it, I think it's not a pretty fairly mind it doesn't have a pretty faith,
I think it is refrigeration.
And even even more dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century is also so on.
We can create creative minds much better than to live a lot better than live.
I know that it was in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to that dark in the dark for me,
Seely the fase in which my career is in which my career now.
Go took only young am, a vehicle.
I can do even four decades to go through decades and maybe a lot of decades
Hoose probably the way that I now will be more more published by the outside world as the work that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can be a little biggest succes: high-biggest success of my biggest success of me.
Jem, what a idea!
If you think about this is you know, it's the morning, you know, it's the morning to negar.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to work with the work that I love with the work I like to love with the work I love to the work I love to the work that I love to work that I love with the work that I love to work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love to the work I love with the work I lo
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I have come to the conclusion that I can just go through write as I can do a psychological protection in the process of the process of the process of the process invest in the process of the process inside the process.
I have to write the writing of a securious distance between mitself and my concern fears of the reactions, and my future published publics.
I looked at ways to ways to ways to do that.
I am in the history and I do is doing me in other civilizations to see or others to see if others have found a better way to help creative process.
My search of my search of old Greeks and Romend.
And I think it's a long and it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romend, and Romend, people didn't have that creativity was of themselves.
And they believed that creativity was a god-partment of a distant place, unknowledge to the human reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasons.
The Greeks called this calls of creativity creativity "demonen."
Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that he had influistered him words of influistenced that he had a demon that he had a demon that he had a demon that he had a demoon that he had a demon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that we have had a demon that he had a
The Romenon the same thing was a kind of kind of idea.
And they were called them a genident creative mind creative mind.
The funny is that the Romends with a genius not a particular piener person to be a particular pient.
In their policy was a genius was a magical god-global entity, which was in the walls of the ateltion of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house else.
If the artistic was working was the genius assistance.
and it was the way he gave on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier over the distance of the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work.
The artists was so in protection to the bunch of narcism.
If you were brilliant work, you don't get all the home.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genius you had helped to have helped to have helped in the way
Do you get a job, then you got that not only to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genion.
Lange time that was that in the Western creativity was considered to be considered to be considered to the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed was changed everything changed in the Renaissance, and everything changed
There was a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual point of the universe and is the middle of all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the godal world,
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individuals.
And for the first time in the history of there was a genius and they were not a genius and they didn't have a genius.
I have to say that I think I think I think a big front of the big front.
To one person, one answer individual to believe that he or she is whether she is the vehicles, the source of the century, of everything creative and the known forward -- that's something that creative and the known for a fragmental human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in soft
Ego's become read to gigantic proportions and there are increasingly expectations to prestates.
And I think this pressure has made a lot of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists.
And if that's so -- and I think is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we go back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
We can do 500 years we can rational humanisn't undone in a 18 minutes, in a 18 minutes.
And probably in the audience of people who are reduced scientific doubt of the idea that elfrigerating reverse of the fact that eleras the work of the work of artists to inspiring high-like respiring high-like throw tape of the artists of the audience of the audience of artists are in the audience of the audience of the things that are of artists of the things that are reducated to inside the work
It doesn't seem to make you all that I will get you in that I will get you in that.
And yet, I ask it me.
Why now?
Why wouldn't we have to do that connecte?
It is just as much as wrong as wood as all the other explanations of the totally calculated uncalculate process.
Everybody who have something something to create -- so in fact, so in fact, all the attacks here -- knows that the creative process doesn't always rational process doesn't always rational process doesn't always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process doesn't always rational process to create rational process --
And that sometimes almost paranoral.
I have recently, I have the great American closer Ruth Stone of the American anso.
She is a close to the nine. Her entire life already write they close to close to close it.
She told me about her childhood on the plattle and of Virginia.
Sometimes when she was in the field, they felt a poem -- they heard a poem over the country.
It was so like, as if there was a big wave air came air came air came air came air came air
And so I think about the country, in the country to her device.
She felt that the ground, she started shaped to shake her at that moment and knew that moment to do it in the time to her life.
and they ran to home, backwards by the close and she had to look at the close and then paper and picking.
When it was close by her hand her hand her hold her only was her only chance to write it on the way to write it up.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then they rough, but reaching them, but calculate it house not.
And at the moments are shaving her him by her him, square about the fields, looking for the fields, in her words -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poems,
And I think it was the most of the story -- this is the most of the story -- that they were almost most of the story,
And then she was looking for paper and paper, and paper, and it shoot it by her him by her him by her him by her him --
Juist, she had a photling packs.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she pluned it out of the air.
She paked it to his tail and it back into its body, and it back into her body, as she wwrote it back to her body,
And in those cases came up with the well-well-well-up wrong on paper, but then in the entire gord.
When I was that heard that -- what I thought is a couple of the creative process!
That's how my creative process. I don't am a meum! I'm not a medium!
I am a mouth, who every day on the same time on the same time on the same time and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans on it.
But even in that daily swood, I had a experience experience.
You will also know it to know it yourself, that feeling that there are creative ideas in your releasing from a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that it for bround?
How can we use it without that we get it without a way we get it?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician Tom Was.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life is the shows of his life was showing the toon-image artists that all power of all power of the power that is trying to get on the inconnection of creative impulses that reduce in him that reduce in him that reduce in him that reduce in him of the confronted of his life that reports in hi
And the years of Tom was a little bit more more more rate.
And one day he in Los Angeles on the fast road the fast process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the front of the front of the fast room.
And as he heard that he heard a fragment, he heard a melodie.
The decision, as inspiration that do fathere, independed on the inspiration that is frating.
It was a nice melody and he wanted to get the vasthous.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a paper on no paper at a taneously at the time.
The well-known excited, is the well-up and then the melodies, and then it stays and then it stays and then it stays behind me eternal backwards.
I don't really good enough, I can't be right."
He didn't get a bunch in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat the sky, you can't see that I sat the sense of the sense of the sense of the sense of the sky.
"Do you really think I can write a songle to write a song?
If you really want to do that this is coming up to you have to have to reach later, if I have time for you.
Don't not, anybody else else else.
Ga neighborhood at Leonard Coh." And from that point the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonard Coh.
The work is the way to do with the known dark at the box tom.
But the heavy that creative process in him reports in him expensive in the way he was distant of genion.
The genim was going to close to the skin and living only calling up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go to the inside of it.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the odd and the odd aspect that not completely of Tom itself.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had been profit of it.
I was in the middle of Een, Biddle process of Een, Bemins.
I get a point moment I get away in despad.
You know that you don't want to be work, but not good to couple of the things that it is getting a terrible bad book.
Not just just bad it, really really horrible bad bad and bad bad it.
I wanted to do all the project all project.
And then I remember Tom that was going to be genius, and I decided to way. And I also decided to way.
I wended me from my manuscrips and directly to a very high of the room.
And I said hardoping hardoping thing, we know everything that if this book is not only silliant is that not only is that not only by me.
You can see that I have everything in the way I have in my hab.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you think it's better operate, you have to get your thing to come to do.
Snap you don't have to do that, you don't have you, youammer thank
I just write because that's a work.
Oh, and in the notils are being seen to be solid that is just a differently.
Tja--- Uindically it comes up here on the notice of the things here
Eeugs ago, in the North African deserve people to dance in the North African desert to dance on sacred music.
On hours and hours behind glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes happened to be something extraordinary extraordinary --
One of those dancers were then transcendent.
You know, you have some of what I mean, you have ever seen a thing that I mean, you ever seen something in a performer.
It was like the time and the dance and the dance and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights nights on it.
And suddenly he didn't have a human beings a human being.
In him of him above him blowed it glood.
A godnment,
If something called the something called the same thing happened to people what it was started to clapping them and clapping and clapping them and the clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice of historic fact, when Moren South South Spanin, they brought this living with mea.
The extent is the outside of the century of the century of "Allah, Allah." in "Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okah, ale."
And that hear you have the day at the day and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments today.
If artists in Spanish something impossible, or magically, magically, "Allah, oh oil oil -- oh, violene, Allah, violene, brave."
And it's the way to disease of God.
Precions what we need to have.
Lasty is the dance that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the next morning to the dinary law on dinary lads.
And at that moment he is a little parents of parenty, with regardless of the heights will never come to such up to such a hights.
Maybe there will never be somebody else to have a little bit of the time of these.
What does he have to do with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sells for a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be so much it doesn't have to be too to be very highly needed to be so painful to be so painful.
Imagine that you don't know that the most invited aspects of your person from yourself.
Imagine you believe them to be a time you have a time to be a while,
When you ready ready it, they get them through on somebody else.
And so considered everything.
I high intools that are thought of the thought of the thought of the day.
The last months I worked on a book that inside that will be shall the book that a lot of a lot of far to be excited.
The operating that illuster progress.
And if my mind to the hall, I like the same thing I love me the same one: Don't now.
Then just you work.
So if you do thing thing -- which it is.
If you have job, you go to dance you, and dancing it.
If the god-genius to be constitutes to make in your work on some point at some time in your work on some point, then "Oly!"
And it doesn't matter that no then, then, but it doesn't have to be going on.
And then, "Olen!"
I believe that I believe that I believe that.
"Oh, anyway, because we see human love and it's pure human love and propertly, humans and propertly,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, len!
You know, I had talked about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started a new point, we were the biology to the biology to the digitizing of digitizing that digital code to a new fashion, and now we are the biology and synthetthetc of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions of ask questions
"What's life?" is something that I think about some biologists have tried to understand the different levels.
We tried to get different approach, it back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitizing now,
When we have sequenced the human genome of the human genome of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask life -- we can we live new, or can we create new, or can we create new, out of this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organize Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genomes for a kind of that can be a kind of that can be a laboratory in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at whether we can get a nature smaller genome.
We can go from hundred genes and go out of the 500 or something, and it are.
But if we look at the metabolc map, is that relative to the metabolo.
And this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at a piece of the genes that would be a living cell cell.
And we decided to do that the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of components so that we could deal to make the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started a chromosome synthetis?
Sat the chemistry it to make this very big molecules, we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, if we do that, a chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of """"stine?
A chromosome is but a piece of chemically, a piece of chemical.
So, our tempo of digitize of digitizing life is accelerator of exponential wise.
Our possible to write the genetic code of the genetic code slowly slowly of the enduring code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the geneti
And our last point it would put it on this point on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some stages for neethical stages for a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical represents.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be a very hard to be the synthesis of the synthesis of D
There are tiends of machines in the world that little pieces in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length of a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of the packs.
So we had to make a new method for the conditions of these little pieces and the corrigerate of all the errigation of all the errors of all the errors of the old boxes.
And this was our first pogone, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria box that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, we did the pieces, the foutcorrections
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we put a piece of chemical chemical stant in the bacteria and the bacteria genetic code of the code of the genetic code of making and virale particles were going to make a little bit of the bacteria --
The viral particles were going to be able to solve the cells, they came back and then the E. coli.
I was until in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model is just well.
They were laught more than you know,
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something a lot bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial chromo
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes, so we could actually experienced the cassettes so we could various --
to understand what the way is the face components of a living cell.
The design is critical is critical information in the computer than that has to be very digital information in the computer than that has to be very accuraat.
When we first did this genome for the genome in 1995 was the standard-precision is one mistakes a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing. If we were 30 pouts. If we were used the original sequencement than it was not in strong.
And the design of the design is design of pieces that 50 letters are 50 letters that have to be a lot of 50 letters to all the other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller sub-unitted sub-unit together.
We design here unique parts in the world.
Maybe you have read that we stopped watermarks in it.
Bet, I think we have a four litery genetic code: A, C, G, and T.
Trios of those letters code for rugggs for rubbs -- that there's an unletters for every aminoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxys.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, though.
We just think of the signal we just got a lot of signal --
Some of them were teleggared that there were no poets were disasting that there were no poemes.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repairs and put together.
And we started making pieces of pieces of pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were five to 7,000 letters were able to 7,000 letters for 24,000 letters of 24,000 letters than sets to 7,000.
In every stage of a cover, we got a diverse of these pieces so that we could sequences them because we want to create a process that is very robuust -- that you can see straight -- that you can see straight you see straight --
We try to achieve the point of automatishing the point of automatish.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And soon as we get to the really big pieces -- over 100,000 basepares -- they don't grow so easy more in E.
That explains the modern of all modern distant tools of molecular biology.
That's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-o-oil recombination is used by the biology to repair, that materials can feel that pieces can feet.
Here's an example.
There's an organized called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million radio radio of radiation.
And that you see that in the top panel, sopm sopm sopm just sopm out of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later it was going to go down and put it back to one else the first of all.
There are thousands of organs that are.
These organisms can be dried up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space, that can professional that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to show that there's a lot of the way, there is a lot of it.
Here's a little microph microph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually actually actually with these processes with the right design of the piece of the pieces that we did in the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design of the piece of the piece of the piece of the molecule microph of the
And it turns out that they feel automatically foot care.
This is not an electron-microscope, this is a regular microscope.
It's such molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes of six seconds.
This is the published we explore until we explain the way
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The moleculecubriance is more than 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without springs to be only to the genetic code of the code code of the code code of the genetic code.
Well, how do we started a chromosome chromosome chromosome of chromosome of it?
And it's obvirus is the clearly easy.
And it's a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you an eukaryots, like us, you know you know the cell out of the cell and does another in, and that's what you know as the cell and that's what you know as the reading.
And in the bacteria species of chromosome of chromosome of integrated transplant that we have a complete transplant of a chromosome transplant of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to a other, and it can be activate the bacteria of chromosome of a cell transplant to a complete ength of a chromosome
We have a chromosome of a micro-size of a microbes.
These are about so far as far as people and moved and mosquito.
We put some extra little extra to take for this chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the extra to the chromosome of extra genes that we could select for this chromosome extra chromosome of extra chromosome extra little extra chromosome extra little extra chromosome extra chromosome extra mosome extra little bit of extra fied to this chromosome of the extra to the extra
We have it to make an enzymes to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein with enzymes to make all the protein with enzymes to make all the protein to make piece.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to so. But we tried to so. But we tried to develop the process of what happens to be able to get a process of the process of what beyond to so.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We found all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of chromosome of a third chromosome of thousands of property of property of traffics in one time to the species.
People that evolution evolve as if one changes of it as if one changes of biology.
There are enzymes that are restrictive enzymes are called DNA that actually described DNA that actually restrictive --
The chromosome that was not there was a cell of it.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stopped -- well,
It was expressed and it was expression, and it recognition, and it was a strange of material, and we had only the cell we had only the cell of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of material,
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the cararacteristics of one species and change the new species and changed in the new species, based on the new software that we had in the cell.
All of the protein changed membranes changed -- when we were the genetic code was changed exactly changed the exactly changed the exactly changed.
This is a main as a genomical alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change.
Good, I pay that this is not a creation of this is not a creation -- this is prevalors on 3.5 billion years evolution, and I pay that we may be almost a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of new species of design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty much as you look at what you need is to look at what it is.
We're going to go into nine of six-a-a-a-half billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planet...
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 46, that there are four there.
We have trouble with food, with the heavy water, medicine, medicine, fuels for the six-a-a-half billion.
That's hard to do that for notice to do that for noise to do that for now.
We use five billion tons of coals, more than 30 billion tons of oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than also to replace; then that is that a huge challenge of course,
Then of course, of course, all of these carbon dioxide of the state of the atmosphere.
And by all our worldwide, we have now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is coming out of the electronents, and the diversity that is that from the diversity that is that coming out of the electronics of the electronica-entic industry that is that is that is that is that is that is
We are preserved by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques of techniques synthesesemethods to do so-called combined genomics called combined to do that.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes and try to optimalizing processes to optimalizing octons to produce octon, new vaccinins, then we can change with a small team of molecules, then we can do more molecule-biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's only a selective selection.
We can select select life-fatbirth chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real design design design is where we work, so you can really go on the computer and a new kind of on the computer and a new kind of on computer can design a computer in computer and a new kind of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the real design of the things that can design and a new kind of a screen of a screen of a screen of a new kind of of a new kind of of of of design.
We don't know how it will look at it.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We fourselves now fourth generation fuelels.
On the ground, you have seen to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuels that will come out of sugar as sugar to more highly higher fuels like octan octan octan ack-fuel-od.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food price is higher and the available and the available is as we start with CO2 as we begin to be a food predicted and so we are cells to design that ways, and we think that are doing it in that way, and we think that we think we think the first generation of the first generation of sources.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries of discoveries have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organizm that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, at cost temperatural.
It makes methane of molecular hylecular hydrogen as energy sources.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 and we can take a pipell through pipes to face fabried, where that CO2 is going back to fuel to fuel to fuel to fuel to fuel this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to break out of the basal question: "What is life?"
We actually have a real, you know -- the deprotected of the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED where you can do, where then you can do.
A important energy source of energy source.
But we also work on the too, we also use these tools to think about quick vaccines to think about vaccines of vaccines to think about the too.
This year there was the griculture, we always have a little bit behind the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that change by teforming vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines.
Here's how the future can see the future can see the evolutionary tree, the evolutionary tree, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still distant to improve people.
Our goal is to ask that we make a chance to survive to survive to survive to survive to do that maybe you wouldn't do that.
What I want to show you as a little bit of like to show is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedrag
And it's a environment where you locally locally or on the distance with immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at the time here is a lot of digital images and can be able to keep up here on the way up and extending to our wish and except the sorts to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at it, how big this collections or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapix.
It all makes nothing because it would be only affected the prestations of the prestations on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-picture of the data.
This is the graduate house is by Dickens. Each coluface.
To prove that it is really text, and not a picture, and no picture, we can do something something to show that this really isn't a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange of strange way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read an e-book way to read a way to read a way to read a way to read a way to read a way to read a way to read an e-book way to read a way to read an e-book way to
I wouldn't be adapty.
This is a realistic. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of an underdeal.
This really gives you the pleasure and the experience of a real paper, or newspaper, or neator is actually a scale medium is.
We also have something done something with the corner of this extensive of the Guardian
We have a nice resolution of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the constitutions of hands through the screen.
We hope that this is not pop-ups more more means and other third -- not need to be more more than it is not necessarily to be more of the flaul --
Of course, of course, a way of nationship for a technology as a technology as this one, I won't spent time to talk about this field, except that we can also spend a lot of a lot of except to this fields of a lot of state in the hand it is a lot of the supplant aper of technology as a lot of technology as a lot of technology as a technology as a technology as a lot of technology as a technology like this, like this,
These are all the roads in the U.S.
on top of the top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now living live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, who connects two techniques together.
One is Seadragon and it's a very nice piece of computer vision research of Noah Snavely, provenessive to the University of Washington, with Steve Seitz on University on U.W.
and Rick Sselfis-Microsoft Research. A nice cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this -- we see that we have to experience the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution of the images.
The room of the images of the images has this meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images have built together so they were removing with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are seeing diassions of images, and all these things are of images.
I don't know if there is a different environments to show you another environments --
There are a lot of space televisier.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we worked about this summer -- to the communicate of the environments -- to the realize of this technique of the environments of this techniques of the environments on our website.
We had to reach with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with pictures of Flickr. You just look for the images of Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the crazy of the Notre Dame in Flickr.
And each of these orange chirs a picture of image that model of this model of model that was part of this model of model that was part of this model of model that was part of this model of this model of model that was part of this model of this model of the orange of this model of model that was part of this model of the orange of this model of the orange of this orange of model that was a picture of image that the kind of a model of image that orange of the orange of the orange of this model of the same thing that was was was was
And so this is all Flickr imagine that are in this way of copied in this way of copied --
And we can do a simple way way night.
You know, I never thought that I would have ever worked at Mrosoft would work.
It's overwhelming here is so extincluding here.
I believe you can see that this fielth cameras, everything from globe: everything from gloflexcameras, a big number of of it, a big number of them together.
I will try to find some strange images.
There are so many of them are so much by facing faces and things like that.
And somewhere this is actually a series of photographs -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also churness by the program.
If we have a physical picture, in a physical picture, in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now using the data -- of everybody -- from the entire collective gets of how to do it looks like this, and copies looks like this.
All these photographs are becoming together and shapes together than the partment of the partment.
You have a model that from the entire Earth of the entire Earth of the entire Earth is
So this as a consequences at Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use, and the previous of the prepared of the people who used to use the people who use it.
Their own photographs of metap-data that somebody else inved.
If somebody would want to get these heavy and their names, and their names, then my photographs and they can be agree with all of these data, and I can use as a access to the space, and that metap-versus of cross-versus of cross-model, and created social experience.
And of course, it's the be-product of immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who not only only from air, who not only only from airs of adadadaday. But also expensive images and other applications is -- but also from the collective seases of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what you see is possible, in the next years, in the next years, all of the images that can copy?
BA: Yeah. What this is really doing is discovered.
It creates to your wishh-your wish-pulling images.
And it does that basis of the data in the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the richchchchalization of semantic information that much of these pictures.
When you look for imagineering the web of images, you focus in a search and the text, and the textest on the webpage of information about what the imagination.
What if you have these imaged imagey is to all your image?
Then are the number of semantic connections and the amount wealth of wealth that comes out of the massive of that comes out of the networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and enographic research is the possibility to live between those who are not forget to live in the wind, who are not forget in the wind, and the posted in the wind, the profited stone in the profites of the profits.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still predicted the Milky away or that the mythes of Inexcent with meaning is actually a lot of inextent is still in the Himalaya boodhood on the ades of Dhard to remind of Dhar, reminds you really reminds that we live in a life: the world in which we live in a lives in a absolutely model of the endurness of the reality, but is not a cassive model of the reality,
the consequences of an apping set apping choices that created our ancestors of generations ago.
Of course, we all share the same distant recently, we are born. Brenrenrenes children in the world. Brenrenrendered children in the world.
We all make insangles.
Omust be with the inctive distinction by the box.
So it can't be surprising that we all of them, dancing and art it.
But interesting is the unique of the until and the ritm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is the Penan in the wold on Borneo, or the Voodoma's acolites in Haiti, or the freeders in the Kaisu-de-wrong in North Kenya, the Curandero in the Andesa in the hard of the Caravanai in the heart of the Sahara. This is the man with the desert of the desert of the desert of Carder of Qather -- or a holollo.
Everest, the godin-mother of the world.
They all learn us that we can be able to think different, we can think different, we can orient ores.
If you think about it, you can just give this idea of you can only give you a lot of it.
Samen shapes the intelliable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and culturally life that the planet and the biological lives is as important as the biological life: the biosphere.
This cultural life-life-e-enos; you can imagine as a enos;
The enosing feet you can define as the totally of all the thoughts of all the days, myths, myths, and inspirit and inspirit are restions that are previous imagination since the human consciousness since the beginning of our consciousness.
The enosing is the big nalatenacy of humanity.
She is the symble of all that we are and all that we can be as amazing newsing newsing newshape.
like the biosphere is the biosphere is the enosed is the enosed that eventually -- and even in a lot of bigger mate.
No biologist, you know, it would be able to be concerned that at least half of all the species on the point of extinction because it's not true.

The big anthropologist, Mead Margaret Mead that she was peace that we directioned that we can move a general image of the worldview.

The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
And this surface history that we have not given me the idea that we have all the answers that we have all the questions that the next millennia on our path.
If the intelliable cultures of the world to people are asked the meaning of people, they answers to 10,000 different voices of voices.
And it's in that song that we have been discovered the possibility to be what we are discovered species that we are working on the work and all the cassumps to be flowers. There are moments of optimism.

This guy, Olayer told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always gone to the Inextinction. In the 1950s, to focus on the 1950s, to focused on the 1950s,
The opa of Olayed to go.
The family family for his life and recorded for his life and recorded him all his his tool.
Now, you understand that the Inter not afraid for the col; they were using it.
The gize of their sleeas were making cause of their sleeas in clide of fish in caribs.
Olayer was not afraid for the poolnaked or the storm that was the storm that were called the storm that was the storm that was called the storm that was called the storm that was called the storm that was called the storm that was the poolnaked for the poolnight or the storm that was the storm that was high.

It's independent area. They are independent. They were all the groundary.
It's a amazing example of how a natic enough enough to her people can bit;
And finally, I think it's clear to the most of the way to this high to this high is to the world is that they actually don't really get to all away.
They're somebody elses.
They are at the beginning of the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the time of these children, will be the dreams of these children, just like the influenced of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is explaining the idea that politicians never achieve anything something that never achieve anything else.

We make a fell to travel to the enos-foot culture, with our public, to such a very extraordinary culture, where the incredible, which the incredible, so hopefully under the most of the most important barrassing of anthropology will be in a variety of anthropology and plual world that we can find a way to live in a multiultiultic world and pluralistic world and pluralistic world
where all the way of the entire of all the people.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some questions that I have a book that I have wwonder a book that I wonder a book of the question.
Maybe you see paralls with information of other sources.
I also try to put some some connected, I also try to explain that you might have a little bit of a little bit of the connected.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma luids as follow: Om the well-to-single levels on the highest level, we need to give them so much as as possible individual freedom of the freedom.
Freedom is a big good, an essentially part of the human beings are the human being.
And the top of the top of freedom to across to treat its own inselling a higher well-well-well-well-well-well-up of thir.
The ultimate freedom we find in choicicopportunity.
More choices hold in that people have more freedom of freedom
And more freedom means automatically means more well-well-of-well-of-well-of-freedom means of automatically means
This is so deep in our society that no one would be deep device.
And in our lives is this dogma urban is a step of spoke of a step of spoke of a step of spoke in our lives;
I'm going to give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
Narly that 175 size of the entire threats are in my supermarket of these are entire market virgin oil and twal-both of these balas as a gaps.
And that you can make a tasy of tallow to the case of the case between 175 species for you, nothing to it.
So that's the supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can put your stareoset -- loud of them -- loud-player -- cash player, radio, restursudden, radio, surprise.
And in the one electronicawincle climbing out of this number of the number of the number of answer.
You can put it together a six-and-half million systems, with parts of the store.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
And another example -- communication.
When I was young a long ago, you could ask all kinds of phone services and the Ma Bell.
You didn't hurt it up. You bough.
That had the way the fact that it never piece of the stell never piece of it.
That time is fore;
Today, there are a lot of different across appearance.
And in cell phones is the diversity is immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the mp3-player, neush-player, and crative break break and cratic break.
And the way you don't have this model that model in the wincle in the wincle that happens in the wincle that happens to be solid of the wind-solid --
The consequence, people come to the wincle and assumpt this question.
And you know how the answer to that question,
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobile of mobly to buy that doesn't do.
And in aspects of life that are more importantly, than the attackle of the stuff, this explosive explosive to a fact of choices a fact.
And it's not a health care, it's in the United States inavers not so that you go to the doctors and you tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A -- or we can do B.
A has this one and, and after that.
BB: What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doke, what do you find is what are you find is what do you find is what do you find is what do you find is what I think you find it?"
And the doctors says, "A has this forward and BB, and BB, and BBut, and nail.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do -- if you were me -- if you were doing me, what would you do you do?"
And the doctors says, "But I'm not you go."
And we call that "own inbringing the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decisions of decisions of somebody with resistance of things -- to a life's doctors -- to a likely and not the best condition to make decisions of condition to take decisions -- the patient. For recipments are actually made much more recivable to take a lot of advantage of advantage of advanced --
Good considered that nowhere it is because the purpose of it, because the goals.
Why do do do if we can't buy them?
Because they think we think we think we have the next morning our doctors to ask that other notice is to ask that other notice.
Our identity, yet an engineering aspect of us are now overnight, as you can see on choices, as you can see on this slides.
Our identity, our identity, of our background.
We find ourselves out -- so we just want.
Everybody morning, you have to think about what person you want to think about what person you want.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that freedom that free everybody out of the people of them out of the way, and then as quickly as possible, and then as possible.
The only reality was the only choice was with well, not when and what you do you go and do it.
And now is free everything to the operate is to the way to the operate of the way to the opportunity.
I give you a little intelligent students, which I have done at less house works.
They don't have heave or away or air or in the earlier than in the earlier time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Spect I whether or now? Do I have married now?
Or do I wrong up with that, I first children, or a career or a career re?"
These are all single questions.
They go through to them to answer to them, as this means that they don't have all their housing and there no good cif.
And they have right. They're important living questions.
And then we come to work. Carl just as a thing that technology is to work on every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of the world where in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, by the way, which I love gets of the WiFi does.
I don't walk along because I want to keep the place for mic.
But good, who are massive choice, and they have to ask us to ask us to ask us and then go and rocking, or not.
We can look at a footbalth of our son, with our son, with our son, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and the laptop on shoot.
And even if they all get out of the way from the axy, we get every minute of those wheat all sorts of questions, "Am I ask this phone answer?
Is I just this emailt respond? Are I write this letter writing of this letter?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is, we experience the football of our sond-a very different way.
And what we look at the big, the small, materialistic things -- life is a question, life is a question, it's a question, it's a question.
This is how the world was used to look at it.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choos;
And so the world looks like.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad it?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about what is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad to it.
That huge choices are two effects, two effects on the human effects on the human effects on the human effects on the human beings.
A very opposite effect is that it works more more than limbing than freedom.
And so many choice, they find people the hard to make it hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example, a research to investment in volunted-investments in voluntears.
A colleague of mind to invest investmental data from Vanguard, a big policy profoundation with about a million employees with about 2,000 million employees about 2,000 vefings.
They found that for every decades of any dealing of the work-foundly away that the work-took two percent called the partnership.
And in five-founds. Why?
Because it is at five-foundly square so hard to choose that people just explain to the next day, and it looks out and that I looked at the next day, and so on.
And from extincluding out.
That doesn't mean that means that people after their pentive to eat the time they don't have have enough money because they don't have enough money because they have been seeing the choice as much as a little bit of the choice as they have been a versadarly shed to have create the choice of them have created for creating that they have been separated for a lot of people who have to have a
And they were walking to get to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose, for.
The worked very much of the worked to divast their own contributtor of their own contributtor of their own contributtor was a bunch of the worked to connect their own contribute.
So many choicy can be a bunch of choice, so you can work on the botom.
And I think the world is looks like that.
If it goes to the century to the century to the right choice very high to the right choice mas;
You don't want to be explained with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second thing is that if we were the laming of our disaling and choose of the result of the result than it would be less of the result than it would be if we had less options have had less options.
And there are multiple reasons for to feet.
One of the one of choice, for example, for example, they can look at the engineering that the choice doesn't have perfect.
You ask you a case that would have been a different choice would have been better than a any other choice better than that.
This dream alternative is the alternative to you get out of your choice.
And it is a break on the enough of choice that you have made you have made it up, even if it was a good choice choice that was a good choice choice that was a good choice of the choice that you have made a good choice.
The more options are there to be more easier it is to easier to have uneasier of the choice chose of options.
A second reason is to do with substitutic costs.
Dan Gilbert gave morning, all of how many things we depend the value of things that we depend up with the things that we compared it.
If you can indentivate many alternatives you can see many alternative opportunities of all the alternatives you determinatives you determinatives you determinatives you determinative that you die.
That makes you fewer tape with the alternative that you have chose to be code.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stress-example.
This is a stel on vailable in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second lawing.
They are sitting to a wonderful strand. Straling weather. No human in fact.
Don't be right? "Don't be a balan," thinks that man, "it's author.
Everybody in my neighborhood is in Manhattan is the city ouple of the city
I could flow my car for the door-high-hit for the door."
And he is two weeks, with the idea that he was a great parking place.
The taneous costs are going to cost of the people, even if we have a great choice choice, even if we make a great choice choice.
The more possibilities are more possibilities of alternative alternatives.
And those presents are present as substitutional costs.
One example.
This image stories to some points of points.
Like it right now and for example, and you don't have to get things to up.
And another choice is that you have a choice other choice other choice.
And all that other has that other has been so attracking cans, which the choices are fewer to be reverse to be touch.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this kind of a new bunch to a new birth to a new birth.
I almost always speak almost always played it.
But the birth of there was only one kind of a kind of spirit doesn't bough, and it bought it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the bunch a long enough and often enough and often enough and often enough wasted to be awasted and often enough it was OK.
And after years I went to the wincle for a new;
I said, "Well, I want to get a stuff, this is my me."
And the window said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Do you whether or a rit? Would you be a stone-washed or acid?
Do you have a bunch with clos?
Do you something explaining pipes, or flink or flink out, and so he went through and so he went on.
I was talking about it. I said, "I want to say a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want the only one."
He had no idea which was not a hour for an hour hours a hour for a hour of the potential of all possible market --
I think it's honest, I was a reported pultimately explored with a extensive birth.
I had done better than I could do do it better opportunities I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Or this to myself, I wrote this to myself, I wrote a book in a book of the book
The reason I didn't feel better with all of those choice, was that I started expecting a lot of good stuff.
I started without any any expectation, because I just just one kind of spiracy --
Then there was a different ware, and one of them would be fast perfect.
And what I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I compared my bend, I was my expectations, and that asked me telehome.
How more possibilities of people have to have more expectations they care of the desertions of that possibilities of those possibilities.
And that means people are less to be less of results, even if the good results are with results.
Marketings people don't know this not.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
In the really is going to be about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse when they were worse to people were pretty raised experience.
In our modern society we can be as well as a well civil of civil as perfection, but the best thing we ever reached to it, is that something so good as we had ever been so good as we had to have to be as well as we ever have.
Nonce we have been surprising because our expectations, my expectations, are high-high-up.
The secret of happiness -- this is to be a lot of you have all and secret is not too much of happiness is not too much expect too much of happiness --
I want to talk about here -- a car biographic elementally -- I was that I was a woman who is really fantastic is really fantastic is really fantastic element.
I didn't have a little bit with less tpeacement.
But with less enough of takes are good side.
And finally, when you get a bad on a bad bad of the things that you can get a bad as there is only one kind of pre-up, you can ask why you can you ask why you can you ask why you can you ask to why you see why you can be describe a bad of the suddenly en
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsible. Because you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds available and you can get a that turns out to fall, who is responsible?
The answer is just so simple. That's just so simple.
You could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different greenhouse to failure.
So if people decide, even as people are decided to be closing the results of those decisions are good, they are teleging.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society has been clinical depression under the younger generations of high-generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the write of the younger generations
A factor -- not the end, but a significance factor in this explosive explosive and suicide itself, is that people have been so often have to have been so far to have because of their high expectations.
And if they try to explain themselves, they try to explain themselves, they give themselves the wull itself.
So the nettorage, so the nettoraged objective we have talked to prevent it, but our bad of bad in it.
A little bit another one collabor.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be aware on what is to do is the official dogma,
But that's not the way it is not a lot of it.
It doesn't suffering a doubt that can choose better than not can choose them, but it doesn't have caught cause it more choice that is more choice is more choice is more choice as much better than you can choose better than you can choose it.
There's a magical groundaries on choicical. Wely, I don't know.
But I know that we have been a long time we have to have a long time that we have a lot of us well-well-well-well-well-well-well.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost finished -- a principle where we can keep the best thing to keep the best thing to be able to keep the best thing --
The choices of industrialized countries comes out of material is coming out of material overly.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about what we have heard about that there is no much choice is that there is too much choice there is too little choice, but it's too little choice of choice,
So the paradox that I speak here with the moderne, so the moderne, well, which West.
That's frustrated, and this is all this: Steve Levitt you yesterday you told that expensive and hard to instally. Sunt of your money. Suncky of your money.
I say you the same thing about this dure, complicated choices -- they don't help no: they help now: they got switness.
They make us life's life's life's life's life's life's life's life."
If a part of what people in our society is able to make all of these choices to have been overbehaving all of the operating people have to have been able to get to some of those people who have to get to exactly away of people on it.
And we have to go forward to go forward.
That's what economists a Pareto-improve being.
Everybody is better by reverse of well-single -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the choices that we have to become our of choices that we are with our behavior.
And finally, if you read this image story, you read this picture of a guy -- you know, what know?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scree example, a shortile worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it, I think about it, I understood that this fish is the same smart is a smart.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you get the fish of the fish of the capabilities, you don't have a freedom.
If you get the fishing to create opportunities to create opportunity.
It leads to more distant and less textackagement and less text.
Everybody has a fish.
This is free to constitutes -- possible even for the fish.
But the determination of a figure-fishing issue is to ask questions to ask and well.
Thank you for your attention.
