Last year I showed these two sdias, to show that the pool, who was the pooler that the pool, who had about the size of the response of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States,
But this particular is the nst of this specific problem because it doesn't show the disk.
The ice skap on the North Pole is in a certain sense, in a certain sense,
It set out in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a spent version of what the last 25 years is happening is happening in the last 25 years of happened
The permanent ice is disrood.
As you can see it out of darkly blue.
That's the year, that you have the winter.
And the frine-summer.
The so-called o-hand ice or older, five years of old, is almost like flower, that from the body that is taking out of the body is there.
In 25 years of this is going to this up.
And that is a problem because the frozen frozen frozen frozen frozen frozen and there are a very big amount of frozen womestics finds that you have been boundaries that is dead.
Commacient amount of disconnecting in the atmosphere, that could be double that can double that we clearly double if we critten the debattacks.

Whoo! She's OK. The question is the question is to be that whether we will be that wone.
A reason for that, this is that this huge warm-heat Greenland from the north warms.
This is a meltwo-aterriver two.
The water volume is the water-volume bigger than oose.
This is the Kanger-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea single style because it is mely, this is the place where it comes in the sea.
These flow these flu.
On the other hand, the South Pole, the biggest ice mass on Earth.
And the last months reported scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole of the South Pole at the meltilands.
The whole continent is for six meters sea soundary, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two of largest ice massa, are new notice that there are new notice that was still glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population is gets the world population is that meltile water from that meltary.
In the Andes, is this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more poaching.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California, there was a 40 percent in the snowpak of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are nice.
This global dreamed dreamed to a dramatic fy-like for-burns.
And the number of nature, the number of nature.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the preventing 75 years.
This pattern is completely unked.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, look at the east of the U.S. Stille Ocean, and all of the United States, and each size of the India's subcontinent, there's a drastic dalation.
The only great cause of the earth, narrative warming, nearest deforestation, which is the burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels, is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuels,
Olie is a problem, and it's a very biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest of the two biggest of China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coal-carbon centrales.
But we see a birbrith.
These are the coal-carbon which the bit-coal-making both in the last years, and where big-alternatives were proposed to have forgeted in the last years.
There is a political fighting to the gest of our country.
The coal carbon -- and oil industrial gave years to do about 250 million dollars to promote "scholary, spending coal coal coal of deal.
And that picture did something that I think about something that we have to think about that.
And the Christmas was at me at home in Tennessee, about four billion liter coolmodel.
You probably seen it in the news of news of the news of the news.
This is the one after one after the biggest waste in America.
This happened to the Kerst.
One of the advertisements of the babove competition of the Kerstrong was this:
Video: ""Frosty the coal man is a key of key is a key, very high choice,
He's overliquid away in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coal guy is scaling scale.
He's paid and estimate and employees their job and employee."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia from the coal in West Virginia froms.
The biggest mines of the country is the great bable, of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship me to be clear --
Al Gore: So the Allimate, the Allimate, has two campaigns on the told of two campaigns on the board.
This is a piece of one of it.
And Video "ALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our business.
That's why it is why the most important goal is to give a giant enter-engineering to address the light for the light and bring the light of the truth of value carbon.
Fit is, coal is not very smaripe.
We like it is clean -- and it still -- and it still really, it again.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just talk about us.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-modern shan emergency of schan coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-coals.
Fantastic! The machines are making very slowing.
But that is the sound of clean coal technology.
Despite the fact that the break of coal one of the main causes of warming the earth is remarkable of the Earth is shaping schone carbon technology that you see here.
Look at the time, this is the clean coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, past the positive alternative to our economic challenges and that they were on the area of national security.
Video: Stem: Stema crisis, the national security of the national security of the climate crisis.
The red is all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel like disanchoil.
But now there's a new solution to get out of the ft, new solution to this.
And so, America of 100 percent of schan ell electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to work to work work, a plan that makes us safer and the warming of the Earth and the warming of the Earth is to be safer and the warming of the Earth
And finally, a solution that reverse enough that reverse is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Design.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: Itâ€™s re-in-energy.
One of the fastest ways to make an end to our dependence of old to our dependence of old fuel that our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to make a end of old fuel of old ways to help our

Al Gore: There's an old African speakword, "If you want to be soon to be all of the time.
If you want to far far far with you."
We need to go, and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with an update about how that machine works.
So here I am for the ones that don't war, the LHC is the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever undernearly 27 miles in engaged in engaged in your entertaining --
It has to be the circumstances that were attacked less than a billions of second after the universe started to be a second 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious, s!
This is the machine under Geneva.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It's the ATLA, AS detector -- 44 meters in diameter in diameter in diameters.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the connections so you can see the scale.
And at 10 sepily last year, we spend the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by AS.
And that causes for a party in the controlling room.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that was all around the LHC was going to go all around LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which are flowing particles in the detector of the detector flow up the detector of the detector of the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture at 10 September we knew that the machine, which is a huge over-winner is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of the Internet page and saw that the Internet page that the Internet page out of the Internet page that the Internet page of it.
That means we have made a cultural as a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of that we have made a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of that we have a science of cultural as a science of cultural as we have a science
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden drams.
And those bears ago 13 thousand amplifs when the machine on entirely working at the entire power working about the entire power.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they have superago, because they are super-a-temperatures.
So on min 27, colder than the space between the stars, that can behaviors that are flowing that flow that flow that flow the flows that flow slowed the behaviors can behaviors that flow up the display of the stars, that are flow over 271.
In one of the connectivity between nine magnets in the LHC, was a constructivate.
And then the wire was something warmer, and was intended to that 13 thousand of electric resisting 13 thousand ampeering 13 thousand call.
This was the result.
This is more impression if you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons of 20 tons away from 20 tons were mostly 30 inches were mostly mostly than 20 centimeters.
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did we do.
We all have repairs.
Now, they're back to the point.
Eind map the LHC will be intact.
We will set it back back and we expect measures in june or right so we can go and look for example, so we can go and look at what the building of the universe.
Now, of course, have they unfortunate the debate of the value of scientific research. It's easy.
I think the fact that it's so hard to be so hard to go further, the value of things like the LHC.
I let the last words to the English scientist Humphanage, die, I had to define the decades of the value experiments of his learning his student, his student was so dangering to the progression of human mind to the progression of human mind than to take human minest than our images of human minest than we have science that there are no new to be not a mysteries in nature, and that there are not a new world's complete world, and that there are no new world."
Thanks!
I would like to start to ask you to ask your children at your children at your children at your children playing.
And when you discovered how to grab and they were going to take up and conscious, you were actually learning to solve the problems with and hands of space relationship to the entertaining of space relationship to go on the entertaining of space relationship to go on and consculple to go to and interinteract with the teaching of the room to grab and conscious, and I was going to solve up to the resolve to des and conscene of space relationship to solve to go to ded.
Ruimtely is very powerful because understanding the world to understand the world to understand the world to us.
If a information of information, inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- and with objects -- and my fish -- and my fish -- and my fish -- I started to ask me -- what if we use a computer -- what if we could use a computer -- what if we were using an enduring that one mic, that moves on a fingertip that moves on on a plate debattbate, which we can deal with the both information to deal with the neivere of the neath of the neath of the neath of the neath of the nth of the neighbors of informal informal informtic interact of the news of the neighbors of the neature of the neature of the neature of the neivest interacts that that that that that that
and can ordering as we want to do it?
And these question was so connected us to find an answer answer, by building Sifttables.
Sort cookilled a Siftable computer size a computer size of a cotttable computer size of a cottable of the cottable of the size of a cottable of the size of a cotttable computer size of a cotttable to be a cottable to interactive size a cottable of interactive computer size of a cottable computer is a cottable to interinteractive computer size a cottable of interactive computer size
They can be moving with the hand they can feel together, they can feel their movement and they contained a screen and they contained a screen and they have a sact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traility, just like blocks can they get down to grab them down by the grabbed to grab on it.
And the equivalent of a new example of a new new ecosystem for ways of digital information.
And that these helping resources have a more physical differently, are of their movement and each other, and even of the way we move them, there are different new and nice interactions of all the new and fun interactions of the world that we are moving to be aware of their movement.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that that is played by too opportunity and others and others others and others and others:
This interactive portraits of conscious.
Indians are almost of the side, they will interest for each other.
If they are surround, they can also do this and can be a little bit and become a little bit of nervous.
Everything they feel and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all, the use of all, the use of all, as it was a fluid of a color as it was a liquid of color as it was a fluid of color as it was a fluid of the interaction of this interaction is a fluid consequ
In this example, three Siftables emerging for and I can use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and be available to go and use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and use them to be a very empty of the sup
If we have threw over, we got a little bit back.
There are some of the neath for education, predictly, predictly, predictly, mathematics and logic that we want to give people the possibility to prove things quickly, and the outcome to see the outcome to immediately quickly.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci accounti by a very simple computational calcular programmate.
Here we show a game that is a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of every Sifttable, and shaped in every Siftle, and shaped words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is that it is rehably rehash of letters with a new series of letters with contributing possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I sleeped them to the Media Lab, and to make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed almost of the instructions are needed instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Move word."
Here are some other people test the test ones.
That's our youngest ber bya tester, right;
And it turns out he only the Siftables would.
For him this was just blocks.
Here is a interactive painting-painted paintings.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language of language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate.
He can new characters in the scene, by just bring the Siftable with that character of the table.
Here he shows the sun emerge.
Video: The sun comes up to it.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene of the scene,
Video: The orange tractor.
Good cha! Yeah!
And by Siftables and the need-sized places and the needle to responsible to each other, and they responsible -- Video: World Waish!
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it pays it goes up.
Video: The cat flying.
DM: The last example I will show today Is a synthesizer and live music and live music that we developed have been a sound producing produces a sound produces like the lead, bass and drum.
Eenyyder has four different variations, which you can choose what you want to use what you want.
These sounds can be in the empty Siftables so you can certain the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the pattern of a very livable effects like reverb and movable effects like reverb and moves.
They are being sound to a sound and applied by the living to operate and adapted by the soundaries.
And if you have the general effects like tempo and volume that are being added on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Sifttables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now, I put the basline.
Video: DM: DM: Now, I add a bate.
Video: And now I copy the movie to the press, so I can affect live the effect living the effect living the effect living the effect living the effect living living the effect of living the impact.
Video: DM: I can cell it very accelerating the office of the distincludes.
Video: DM: DM: Now, I copy the movie to the bas for the bas for the bas for the expression.
Video: DM: I can rere-re-shake the pattern.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything to planning, it very longer and make them very shorter like I want.
In the end of the dimessage the dimes.
Thank you.
Like you can see my passion is going to make new human-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brains and bodied bodies and bodied bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area that we develop in this design area that we develop the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is a bad to a very new generation to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which bring the information of our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to you all to talk to you.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also writing so much more than that.
My whole life I have been on writing writing writing that will change ever change will change that ever change.
And yet there is unfortune to be something happened in my life and career, which I had to re-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-ded.
It started a book that I wrote along the way that I written a memoire: "Est, B, Bidy, that very opposed to my early work all the world and an international exister to my first work and an international exister cellerator.
And the consequence is that people are all over the place, and always tilled me to do and I do.
And we do that -- gets do!
People come to me and ask to me and questions, "Are you going to have not afraid you can never eat this succes?
Don't you afraid your whole life will be writing your whole life but never have a book will published to be where people will write for warm.
Don't you get from?"
And I was dissems, you know.
Of course, that would be very very -- but I remember that I remember over 20 years ago, I was when I told you that I was a teenager.
People said, "Don't you get success?
Don't you get to evidence, that you will have to be suppos?
Don't you afraid your life to this work without any of this work without that there ever ever been able to dievent your broken on the puin of your broken with your mouth with your mouth of bitter?"
Something in that streting.
In the short comes to the questions on that questions on this novel.
Yeah, I'm afraid for all of those things that are called the things that are called called
All of the time.
But I'm also for a lot of other things job, you don't know where everything.
For example, for example, and other engineering things.
But what I write is writing myself the last time that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be afraid for working for the work for which they are to their opinion.
What is so particularly to create processes that we make sure to make us to make the effects of the mind-stesses of the mind-system, which doesn't happen to go all the way to other.
Take my father. He was chemistry, and I can't remember that there was a chemisted to remember that he worked on him to him that he was ever asked to him or he was afraid to him that was afraid for it.
And this is how to say, "Yohn, how is it with your chemblockade?"
No, it was not talking about it.
To fair bear: Phind engineers have been by the centuries have not been the reputation of manically.
Sches verse that have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writing, other creative people have been to be a humans have been very humans to be pretty instable.
And look at the grimming death the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many died you, many times often by own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own stiers.
And even the ones who don't have any suicide to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave town.
In the last interview for his death Norman Mailer: "My each of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty much to say about your life-work.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at it.
We all heard it before, and we've heard it before, and they spent my spirit to accept.
The reason the sense is that creativity is that creativity insuffering to suffering and that a artstene will lead to misere.
And so I want to ask everyone today to ask everybody here today?
Do you do that OK?
Because I think I think about it, I think it's not a very good though, I don't think it very much.
I think it was readed.
And also even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this this century is so that this is so that this century is so that this century.
We can create a lot better creative mines to live.
I know sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live.
In fact, the phase that my career,
Go took you to say, "I am a hundred years.
I can spend four decades.
And though though though everything I will now be published by the outside world as the work that was that extraordinary book successful book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can be able to sit with you: high-biggest success to my biggest success alone.
Jemig, what an idea!
If you think about this is your for your knows at the morning, you know the morning, you know, the morning,
So I don't want to do that.
I love love to the work that I love love to the work that I love love to the work that I love love to the work that I love love to the work that I love love with the work that I love love to the work that I love love to the work that I love love to the work that I love
The question is: "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I can just go to the conclusion that I can just go through writing a psychological protection in the process of the process of the process of in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the conclusion,
I have to write the writing a safe distance between myself and my conversation between mind and my concludes to the responsible publics.
I was looking for ways to do that.
I have done in history, and I have done to see if you felt in other civilizations to see if you have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to go to the emotional complications of creative process.
My search for me has brought to the old Greek and Romend.
And you know, because it's a long and intricity story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romen's time of the old Greeks and believed that creativity was from herself.
Men believed that creativity was a god-mind that creative spirit that of a disconnectivity to the human reasons.
The Greeks called these these guys called the creativity mines of creativity "demons "demons called the demons."
Socrates, believed that he had a demon who was a demon that he was influster to fluist.
The Romends had a species like this.
And you have this was a narrative creative minds.
The funny is that the Romain with a genius with a genius to be an extraordinary piently.
In their polite policy was a kind of magical god-magical god-hurting in the walls of the arty.
A little bit like Dobby the huge of the house.
If the artist was working on the work was working assistance.
And it was the working, he gave to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be working in his work
The artists was so in protection to the very much narcism.
If your work was brilliant work was brilliance there.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genius had helped to have helped up.
Don't get your work on your work -- you know, that not only to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty unlike this.
Long time that we have been to the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed the Renaissance,
And there was a very new idea: the individual human vidual human beings is the middle of the universe and the mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the godal world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individuals.
And for the first time in history was talking about artists said that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they were not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I think a big from.
And to one person, one answer individual to believe that he or she is the cell of century, the sour, the source of the century, of everything that creative and the known preservation, and the known preservation of fragility for a fragility for a fragility for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in swallows to swallow the sun
Egos are re-blown proportions and they are required reportile expectations to prestations to performanced to performance performance.
And I think this pressure.
If that is, and I think, and I think, is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different different things?
Can we back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human beings and creative mysterio?
Maybe not.
We can have 500 years we can rational humanism not unfortunate in a 18 minutes,
Probably in the audience people who are recently recently, talking about the idea that else that else fellow tunate of the fact that else further the work of artists to inspiring high-to-inspiring high-to-maligners to inspirting the whole of the audiences to inspirting people who are the audiences to inspiring the scientific people who are required about the idea of the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole
It doesn't seem to me all that I will get you in there.
And yet, I ask it out.
Why doesn't it?
Why wouldn't we get that thought we must to do that though?
It squeeds just as much as wood as much as all the other explanations of the totally calculate that decided to create the creative process.
Everybody who have to create something that has to create -- so in fact, all this available here -- know that the creative process doesn't always rational process rational process doesn't always rational across rational process is not always rational process to be rational process to create rational process is not always rational process to create rational process is not always rational process to create rational process to create rational process -- so everybody knows that is not always trying to do something --
And that sometimes almost paranormy.
I have the great American closer to the great American closer Ruth Stone of the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer Ruth Stone of the great American closer to the great American closer to it.
And she's a thick in the nine. Her whole life already writing them.
She told me about her childhood on the planning of Virginia.
Some and they were on the work, and she was felt to the work was a poem of attacked to the country.
It was so told she was so that there was a big wave air.
And I poems, then the country to her --
She felt the ground, she was underneath her foot and her at that moment, and she knew her life: ring her life: running for her life.
She ran home, she's single followed and then she had to do so quickly, and then seen paper and paper to go and squickly.
When it poems, it was close by her hundred was that her only opportunity to write it on the power to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
Then she was ring and ring them, but it doesn't reach.
And at these moments are shapoem by her him, disappeared -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poet.
And I also have been able to go -- this this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were almost defined to almost miste.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper the paper and paper the poem by her and her poems.
Junew at that point, she had a potle-walk up with a potled.
And with her other hand, so she told me so, she told me she was the close from the air.
She paked it to the close to his tail, and then it back in her body while she wrote it back into her body and shaping it back to her body and it back into her body --
In that cases came up to the close to what was very close to pack in the paper and then in the end.
And when I heard that -- what is -- what is happen, so I thought that I was going to have to be a creative process it!
This is how my creative process. I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouse of a mouse, which every day on the same time, and swearing with blood, sweird and trans through blood, sweird and trans on the worsty.
But even in that daily swring that daily had such a experience.
You will also know it yourself, that feeling that creative ideas in your own rely from a source that you can identify.
What is that for bron?
How can we use it without a lot of the way we get heavil?
And in a way that is that we is?
The best contemporain example, I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A couple of years ago, I was interviewed it for a magazine.
We had this about that.
Tom is actually a big part of his life life had been a lot of his life had been able to get the contemporary artists that are trying to get to get all the power of the unconservable creative impulses in him of the impulses that diving in him.
With the years was Tom a little bit of a little bit more rougher.
One day he in Los Angeles on the fast road, and changed the process of radical.
And as he heard so he heard a clip, he heard a melodie.
The decided that is a lot of dealing that is doing it dishead, dishead, crowd.
It was a beautiful meloils and he wanted to hit it to hit it the way.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper, he had no pathing, no tanger.
The well-known tension of heavening and then the melodies of head, and then it stays and then it stays me century.
I can't be good enough, I can't do it."
And he didn't care in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
And he looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, can you see that I sat the bottom, do you can be the sense of the sky?
"Deny you really think I can write a song now?
If you really want to get that this song-up to you later even have to address you, if I have time for you.
And it doesn't go to anybody else anybody else.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Coh." And from that moments to the process of the process of very different process of the process of that is very different process of the process of very different.
The work itself, with the balance of the dark of the box.
But the heavy spaning the creative process in him oprypipipating the genius.
The genius was going to close to the skin and lived only but I think of the skin.
And so that there was no reason there was no reason to go on the bottom.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the ownership of Tom and the ownership of Tom themselves.
And that story has changed my way of working.
I had been profit from it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bidden, Bidden, Beminners.
And at a point moment I agree in despad.
You know that you don't want to be working very good and you think it's a terrible disaster disaster is going to be a terrible book ood.
Not just just bad that really horrible.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that are genius who are genius to be a poised to way.
I was going to pull my huscrips, and I focus cripped to a very high of the room.
And I said hard-heard, "Lister thing, we know all of that if this book is not only that if this book is not only because of me.
You can see that I have in all of it in what I have in my head.
More I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it better than you have to do a better than you have to do your thing.
Don't you go? Don't you -- you amount thank you.
I just write because that's one, because that's one of the work.
Oh, and in the notile of the notable to be slowed that to be shaped on off."
Tja--- Usoily it comes up here.
Euwen ago, in the North African desert African desert people to make a month, to though people to make a month, to throw months to sacross sact.
Ones and hours, to the morning, to the morning.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, it happened to be a very very extraordinary --
One of those dancers then transcendent.
You know that I mean, what I mean, you have ever seen something like that, you ever seen something that in a performer.
It was like the time and the dance and the dance of the dance of a poor.
And he did nothing else than the thousands of night and now we have all the time.
And suddenly he didn't just like a human beings a human beings for a human beings for a human beings.
In him, under him of him is above him bits.
A goddly frerereretiny of him.
If something happened to be like like that, knew people what it was Dan she started to clap and crop to crop and crop in the both of God."
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historical fact, a nice of historical fact, when the Moren Spanin South Spanin this habiting with them.
The outcome, the outcome, by the century of the century of the Allah." Allah." In "Olly."
And that hear you hear today at the time today and flaments and flaments and fladyers.
If an artst in Spain something impossible, or magical does, you call odd to say, "Allah, oat Allah, violence, oil."
Actually, a disease of God.
Preciions what we need to have.
Lasty is the dance of dance is the next morning to the next morning, that he discovered that he discovered 11 in the morning.
And at that moment, he is a little elder guess guy with deaths that may never come to such highs.
Maybe there will never be somebody God never took a while there are no more than any of God will never took a while it will be somebody who will be able to smoke his dance.
What do is he now with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell for a creative mind.
But it's not going to be painful highly don't have to be so much as painful.
Imagine that you don't want to come to be the most unusual aspects of your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from you.
Imagine that you believe that you have been able to specify a while to specification.
When you are ready with it, they are given to somebody else.
And so it is the way office.
I hang incentive that are thought to be thought to be the average of the average of the average of the average of the average of the average that though.
The last months I worked on a book that will short. The book is going to be ship. The book where many too much to go to is extincludes to go out to is extincludes.
The resequence of that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me to the hall, I love the same thing, I keep the same one, don't have a job.
And just do you work.
So you just do thing you do is, whatever it is.
If you have task your job is to dance you.
If the god-departnership to make a decision to make a source at some points to make something of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful single source of the wire source of the wire source of the godal genius to make a didle-further, and you
And it doesn't matter that then, then, then then then it on.
And then then, "Oly!"
I believe that I think about hard.
"Oly!"Whate, because we have a pure human love and property of human love and propertile by plumness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ollic!
You know, I had talked about a couple of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started from a new point: we were the biology to digital biology to digital and now we try to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology and synthetanize the design and synthesize of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think have tried to understand the whole thing that have tried to understand in different levels.
We tried different approaches, it bring back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to digitizing the digitizing right now.
When we have sequenced the human genome genome of the analoge world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask living, can we regenerate life to regenerate new life from this digital universe.
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can remultiply for a kind of that can conclude themselves.
And we tried to look at if we can come to a nature smaller genome.
We can go to the order of hundred to go from the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively relatively compared to the unit.
And it has a simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch a piece of likely that this would be very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell to be a living cell of the genes that would be able to switch a living cell of the genes that would be a living cell of the genes that would be able to switch a whole living c
And we decided to think the only route that the only route to synthesize this chromosome so we could actually make the components to make the components to do the most fundamental questions.
And so we started questions like to questions like "Can we have a chromosome of synthetis?"
Staking the chemistry to make these very big molecules that we have never seen before?
And, if we do that, we can a chromosome "easy?
A chromosome is a chromosome is a little chemical inds material.
So, our sales of digitize the digitizing of life is accelerating exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code to lose the genetic code of rather slowly slowly slowly of the genetic code to be rather slowly away to write the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the genetic
And our last point to the last point on this point on a very exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago,
There were a couple of stage for a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult --
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in lenging, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make the piece of the balance.
So we had to make a new method for the conclude of these little pieces and correct the corrigate of all the mistakes.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, did the fell correction
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of a chemical chemical chemical stust in the bacteria and the genetic code of the genetic code gges.
The viral particles were going to became came out of the cells, they came back and they were back and they were back and killed E. coli.
I was unfortune to the oil industry, and I said that model but all to be able to get to faster --
They laugh more than you.
And so we think this is a situation that is a situation where the software building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much biggers.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial of the entire bacterial bacterial bacterial to build
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could various the cassettes --
to understand what the rest components of a living cell of a living cell of living cell to be a living cell to understand what the supposed to be a living cell of a living cell cell.
The design is critical and if you start start with digital information in the computer than to have to be very accurament.
When we first of all, we first did this genome in 1995 was the standard-precision of one mistake a 10,000 basepares.
And eventually we found after resequencing. If we had 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence of sequence than it was not able to start.
My of the design of pieces that are about 50 letters that are 50 letters that have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can design so that they have to design so that they can design together.
We design unique parts in this world.
Maybe you have read that we stopped watermarks.
Bet, we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, G, C, G, G, Good and T.
Trios of those cows for roughly 20 aminozurs -- that there is a very levels -- that there is a very single for every aminoxxxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write, sand, single thought.
And we just know about the signs we just go.
Some of televisible, that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of sokay, we started with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters long, only that you have pieces of 24,000 letters, then they get out of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every time we knew weeks, we have a overfluence of these pieces so we could sequences them because we want to create a process that will be very robusted -- that will be very robustraight -- that will be very robustraight.
We try to achieve the point of automatiseration.
So this looks like a basketbaldie.
Once we come to the real big, we get to the real big, over 100,000 basement -- then they don't grow that easily more in E. coli.
And that explains the most of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to get to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-foundly recombination" that is used by the biology to repairs, that is used by the biology to repair DNA couple of repair of the casure.
Here is a example.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radio radiation of radiation that three million radiation to can.
And that you see that in the top panel, som square just sophic from one another.
12 ots 24 hours later he was going to go down and put it back back to each other,
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drought up to be drought up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely absolutely life can provide life that can promove to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of of it, by the way.
Here is a micro-photograph of the molecule that we did with these processes -- actually actually with these processes with these process.
And it has that she feeling automatically address coopers.
This is not an electron-microscope photo; this is a microscope photograph.
It's such a molecule molecule that we can see it with a microscope.
These are photos, taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we spend up unfall.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by humans, with a clear structure.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-points of letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages to the genetic code the genetic code.
Now, how do we started a chromosome chromosome of the activate of it? How do we go?
And it's clear a virus is clearly pretty easy.
And a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give your own under eukaryots, like us, like we just know the cell and do another in and do another in and do another in and is what you know as it was reading.
And in the bacteriial species is the chromosome integrated in the cell but we have to recently that we can invent a chromosome transplant to a chromosome from a chromosome from a cell and can activate the other, and can activate the bacterial to a other, and can activate the bacterial to a mouse transplant bacteri
We have a chromosome of the micromosome of a microsts.
These are about that all about as people and moved and muizing people and much.
We feed some extra genes so that we could take this chromosome of extra chromosome of the way.
We have been proted, with enzymes to make all the eggars.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will have the very advanced graphic images here, and you can value the new chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell that we have to do this in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell --
We even thought he would come to come to come to the solid of the process of what beyond to develop the process of what to come up with it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovering all sorts of the species that have taken a second chromosome of third or a third chromosome of thousands of self-foot properties in one time to the species.
People who are evolving evolution as if you have one changes at the same time, not got much biology to have a lot of biology
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes are called DNA that actually restrict DNA --
The chromosome was not a chromosome was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop -- well.
It was expression, and it was expression, and it recognize as weird as strange of material, and so we had the cell of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the further.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time disappears all the characterists of the end, and then he completely completely new software that we in the new software that we in the cell software that we in the cell of the cell of the cell of the new software that we invented in the cell of the end, and he was completely short time to the new software that we in the cell of the new software that we in the cell of the new sof
All the protein changed the membranes changed the genetic code was changed the genetic code was changed.
This is a power as genomic, as genomic, but we are in the changes of the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change fundamentally change.
Good, I paid before, I paid that this is not a creation -- this is the previous of boars at 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid that we may almost a new version of the Camban explosions that are inside of the Camban explosic explosions that are dealing to this digital design in this digital design design in this digital design for this digital design
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear as you look at what's needed to what it needs is.
We're going to go including six-and-half to nine billion people, over the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context. I'm born in 1946.
There are now three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946, in 46, that will be four are four are four are four are four are four are four are four are in 1946.
We have trouble with food, with the care of clean water, medicines, fuel for the six-and-a-half billion.
That's hard to do that for nine to do that.
We use five billion tons of coly, 30 billion tons of voly.
That's 100 miloons of lions per day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than also to replace that process than to replace that a huge challenge.
And then of course, all of the carbon dioxide of the dioxide that comes in the atmosphere.
And by all our global discoveries we have a databas, we have a databas, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of that.
We are preservent by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques thanks to do so quickly,
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes per day.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes, or tries to optimalizing processes to make octask to produce octasion, new vaccines, we can change with a small team.
And it's only selection.
We can selecect for life-fatbaly, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real design software where we work, so you can actually go to the crows, so you can actually go to the computer and a new kind of on the computer.
We don't know person how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We are fourth generation now fourth of the fourth generation of fuel
On the ground of your foundly to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out from sugar, like sugar, to more high-digner fuels like sugar, to more fuels like octanol of butanol of butanol of butanol of butanol fuel of butanol and third generation of the sugar to more high-higher and thire fuels that will come up to more highly highly highly highly highly highly highly high and thire fus that sonestable.
But the only way we think biology that biology can have big food without the food price to make higher and the available to reduce the available to reduce the CO2 as his food and so we are celling cells that ways, and we think we are the first four generation generation generation that ways, and we think we are the first fourth generation of burns within about 18 months.
And slight and CO2 is one method -- -- but by our worldwide, we have all kinds of other method.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea, about 2.5 miles of wheting temperature of temperatural.
It makes methane of CO2 with the molecular hydrogen like energy sources as energy source.
We are looking at the way or we can take CO2 CO2 which is easily through pipipes that are re-fabries, where that CO2 to send this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to break out of the basal question: "What is life?"
We actually have real, you know -- -- have the dealing of the petrochemical industrial industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED where?
A major energy source of energy source.
But we work on the tools of these tools to think about quickly,
This year, the flu of flu -- we always have just a little behind the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change by teaching the shapes of temptines.
And here you see how the future, can see because the evolution is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and ultimately eventually eukaryota.
We are still far away from humans to improve people.
Our goal is certainly to survive that we make a chance to survive long enough to do that probably a chance to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as first to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we at a very quickly, which we at a very hundred to Microsoft dragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment that you locally or at the time with immense amounts of visual data can work with visual data can work to work with immense amount of visual data
We look at many gigabytes to digital images and can shake up here at the time to continue to be on our wish and the sort to our wish to our wish and the sort to our wish and the sorts of our wish and the sorts of gigabytes and the sort to our wish and the sort the sorts of gigrate and
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big information, or images or images.
Most of this normal camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixal.
It all doesn't matter anything because it was only because it would be influence to a such of the performance of the same way to be the pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a whole book of non-image data.
This is the grauge of Dickens. Each ach colupper is a main piece.
To evidence that it's really text, and we can do something that we can do something to do to do something to do that this really texty, we can do something that is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a way to read a h-book of read.
I wouldn't add it.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a subsubject.
This is a really gives you really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper of a real paper of medium -- which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have done something with the corner of this example,
We have made a noundaries of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information of information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car and you see it.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure we can really make the limitations of hands through the screen through the screen of the screen.
We hope that this doesn't mean that means and other such flawwke, not need to be more flawys.
Of course, a narrative of our countries are a bad apply for a technology like this, I will spend up to this spend on this field, except that we can contribute this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top on top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is a Photosynth, who are two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful computer-vision research by Noah Snavely, promozed, promoting the University of Washington, by Steve Seitz at University at U.Washington,
and Rick Sselfiski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's meant by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see that we can experience the images of diving and the multi-resolution resolution resolution to experience.
The spent disal sile of the images is here is the scale.
The computer vision of the computer vision of these images have brought together to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized stabilized diashor images, or imagery purpose are space.
I don't know if there is another time there is another environments to show you.
There are a lot of more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more
I love to one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked on this summer, to the communicate of the environments -- to the environments -- to the environments of these techniques on our website.
We had to account with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with the Notre Dame with the images from Flickr, and you get images from people in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images from Flickr.
And each of these orange chests a gives a image that models that are part of this model.
And so these are all Flickr images that are spent to this way of spent --
And we can refrigerate at simple way to follow down.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever worked at Microsoft.
It's overwhelming to be so unfortune.
I believe you can see that this is that this many types of cameras, all of the mirror-cameras, a great number of it, a great number of thing, a great number of it,
I'll try to find some strange images
There are so many covers and so many works and so many of the similar to face
And somewhere between this is even a series of photographs -- here are there.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also chured by the program.
If we have the poster in a diver, in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data -- from the whole collective memory of the entive memory of the entive memory that everyone looks at each other.
All these photographs are emergency together, and a very bigger than the som of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth is departy.
As a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the work of work that the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it as wells the advantages of the advantages for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being able to see somebody else in the way that somebody else.
If somebody all these heils would like to climbes and their names and their names and their names are going to be agree Dame is to all that data, and then I can use as a access to that metap-versus that metap-versus and create a kind of cros-model, and create a kind of cros-model, and create social experience.
And of course, the be-product of this immense of this is an imments rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who is not only from air, satelions and other applies and other applies is dealing from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that makes you software possible, on a day, in the next years, all of the images that can be dealed by everybody on the world together?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovering is discovering.
It creates, to your wish your wise, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the data in the images.
And that is defined when you think about the richching when you think about semantic information that many of these images that many of these images are concludes.
When you look for image, you look for image, you feel a search in the weber of information in the webpage on the webpage of information about what the image we have been given much information about what the image away we do it.
What if now is that image that pictures is to all your images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes from that comes from that comes from that comes from that previous that comes from that comes from that is a classical networking effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasures and of evily evily is the possibility to live between those who are not forget to live between those who are not forget to their past. And they have feeling in the wind, the protected in the wind, the protected by railting bitters.
The science that Jaaguy still the Milky Way, or that the Milky Way, or that the myths of Inextincluding that the Himalaya boodhind the breaths are still to the breaths of Dhar, reminds you remember the anthropology, the world that we live in the anthropology, the world that we live in an absolutely of the antropology, but is not only one is just one of the cash of the worth of the antropology,

And finally, it comes to a choice.
Wile in a gray world of unfor, or can we live a colorful world or want to be a colorful world of diversity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she was deattackable that we direction, amorf that we directioned a general, amorf world image.

This picture I have to the northern point of Baffin Island, when I was taking with Inextly narwal to the Inextincludes.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextinction, to focus were moving them, to focus to fly in the 1950s.
The opa of Olayuk of Olayuk.
The family for his life and uncle for his life and uncle him all his tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Inuit not afafraid for the col; they use of it.
The giles of their bad-a-disprigious disancy of fish.
Olayuks up to the poolnight or the storm of the poolnaked, or the storm that hit was the window that hit was hurt.
He went out, he was left his breezing skin, skin, and poop in his hands. And then the poop started to freeze, he started it as a liming.
And he brought a low-up on the side of the high of the hall.
And then the solid, he was a dog of them.
He unfeled the dog and improvised a harnahs.
Of the ribban he made a baby.
And he was looking at a hundred and disappears about the ice flake, including poems.
And with nothing about nothing that we have talked about it, and this in many ways, state of the Interminal of the Interminal inskip of the Interestial incorner world.
In april 1999 the Canadian government of the Inuit the Inuit the Inuit of the in-founder than California and Texas California and Texas we have new home.

They are defining of human imagination, which are going to go back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these kids, are going to be the dreams of unfortunately, part of the unconcernly of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely from the idea that politicians never achieve anything.

where all the way of the people can be contributons of our consult of our sement.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have been dealing that I have seen a book of the book of the question.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
Like, I also try to explain some sense that you may have been touch that you might have been able to cut you may have been able to spend a little bit of the bitself.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be, the official dogma, the official dogma of Westery, invitiated society.
And that official dogma is awma as a follow: To of our citizens on the highest level of our citizens, we need to give them so many of individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good good at the time, an essential part of human being.
And the such dies. The freedom is to acting us to do to act a higher welfar, to achieve without insanches without insanches of thirds.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically means more well.
This is so deep getting up in our society that nobody would pull that nobody would pull.
And in our lives is this dogma.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle growing.
Even about dressings.
Narly that 175 off-and-balane threat at at all my supermarket tune virgin oil and twice different virin oil and twice different balbalance balance.
And you can make it focus to make your tallow to make a bunch between those 175 species for you, you can't do anything to do you with it.
So that's the atboard of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can imagine your stereoset -- loud speakers, casell speakers, cassetttesple radio, reiner.
At one electronicawinkle your choice from this number.
You can have a six-and-half million different systems, with parts of those store.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Again, a different example -- communication.
When I was young young for you long live, you could all sorts of telephone services, but at Ma Bell.
You hurt the device. You bought it.
And that had the same thing that it never got to be the point,
That time is forb.
Today, there are a lot of different applies of different devices.
And in cell phones is immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with behind game player, and cryer and cry-breaking branding other.
And you don't have seen this model not in the wincell in the wincell of his sure that that square.
The consequence, people come to the wincell and asking this question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do too much does not do.
Also, in aspects of life that are much more important than the attackle of stuff, is this explosive is this explosive increasing of choices are a fact.
Gealth care, it's in the United States is not that you go to the doctor, and that you go to the doctor, and that you tell tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A to do or B to do B.
A has this advances and after share.
By has this front of this and what do you want to do do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doke, what do you find you -- what?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front, and B has the preserves, and then the front of the world.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doke, if you was me, what would you do you do it?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own own inbrings of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but it means in fact, that the heavy of decision of decide of condition of someone who are dealing anybody who are free -- to a liked, somebody who is free and not the best conditions -- the patients of condition to take decisions -- the patient.
Good considered to be somewhere because the goals, because the goals, you can't buy and I cannot buy them.
Why advertising, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we think we are the next morning, our doctor our doctor to ask that other mains.
Our identity yet a price, an entertainment of our existence, now is now overbound, like you can see on this slides.
Our identity is that our background.
We like to find ourselves from -- so we just want to do it.
Every morning, you have to be concerned your own minds.
Let's talk about marriage, the marriage, the family.
And there's a time that free everybody that free everybody out of the caster from that you could soon as possible, and then then as possible, and then then then as possible.
The only choice was with who, why, not when and what you do with why, not when and what you do is doing it.
Now, free everything for the operating for the time.
I lessolly, I lessolly, at least students, which I have done less hururt percent hururban work than the home.
They are not single heavy or than in the early time in the early time.
No, they have it with choices.
"Are I marrust or not? Do I marries?
Or will I wait? Dake up with that first children, or a care?"
These are all set of questions.
They go through to them to answer, as this means that they don't have all their homework and then and not catch a good number.
And they have the same thing. They're important life questions.
And then we come to work with work. Carl gave just that technology is able to work every minute of every day that technology to work that -- except in the Rolph Hotel.
And there's one place, by the way, that I love secret that I love secret --
I don't think because I don't want to keep that place for myself.
But good, who love choice, which is to remove to work that we are increasing to us to work on and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and
We can look at a footbalth of our son, and we can look at our cell phone, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and our Blacks.
And even if they all from sten, are being dealing all of those disappeared with all sorts of questions, "Am I answer?
Are I response this email -- I write this letter --
And even as the answer "Nee" is, we experience the footbald-wire of our son a very different way.
Where we also look at the big, the small, the small, materialistic things, life is a livst, is a living choos; life is a question of choos;
And this is the world used to look at the world.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question.
And so the world looks at the world.
The question is now, Is this good or bad bound?
The answer is, "Yeah.
We all know what is good about what is good about what is good about it.
And that huge choice, the huge choice, two negative effects on human beings on humans.
A very contradiction is that the earlier paralyzing more than living beings than living beings that it works before.
And so many choices people find the hard to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice as much choice.
I give you a very dramatic example, a research of investments in volunted-planns.
A colleague of me got access to invest investment data, a lot of Vanguard, a great policy of about one million employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 fings.
And they found that for every 10 policies that for every 10 polise that the worked far that the worked on the working on the working two percent of the partname of pollend.
As fiftimate ftimes, and they did 10 percent less employees than at five than five sonds. Why?
Because it at fiftimate at fifth is so hard to choice that people just choice to the next day, and they just exposed to the next day, and that they call, and so forth.
And from the point comes from the point.
That doesn't mean that means people after their pentive to eat their pentil because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to have been so hard to have been so hard to have been so hard to make it worked for a lot of the works.
And they were walking to be able to go to a year to their nose.
The working was very willing to double.
So too many choicity can work work to work with lots of choice.
And I think the world is that the world looks like that.
If it comes to the century to the century to you very very love to the right choice mas, right?
You don't want to be regulars with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second thing that we dish the lamming of our dish and choosing the result of our dish than it would be less fearing than the case, if we had less options had less options have had fewer options are like like that.
There are more reasons for to feel like to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, it can look like the choice doesn't look like the choice was not perfect.
You spend up in such a case, for that a different choice would have been better to be a choice better.
This is dried alternative is that you get spired to you get your choice.
And so, solid to the enough of choice that you have made a good choice you have made a good choice that you were a good choice that was a good choice that was a good choice that was a good choice that you were a good choice that you have been a good choice of choice that you have made a good choice that you have made a good choice of the ch
The more options are going to be able to easier to have a spipment of unair which element of the chosen options.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave from how often we depend up the value of things that we depend up to the value of things that we are comparing them.
If you can think, you can inthink, you see many alternatives quickly, you can see the attract of all alternatives that you decide to your desire that you determine for your desire.
That makes you fewer fears with the alternative you have chosen choales.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is a single of squarity in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second and they have a thing,
They are on a beautiful. It's not a human beings in vision.
Don't be it? "Don't make it carry," thinks that man, "It's author.
Everybody in my neighborhoods in Manhattan is the city.
I could cave my car for the door parkers."
And he's sing two weeks, with the idea that he miss every day that he misles, and he misled.
The substanticost of the environmental of the environment, even if we make a great choice of our choice.
The more possibilities are possibilities to be more attract alternatives.
And those are presenting us as a substitutional costs.
Another example.
This image store runs to a number of points.
Life in the and for example, and you don't have to get things to get away to consider things.
Another point is that you have to do with every choice other choice other choice of choice other choice of choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice of choice other choice of choice of choice of choice is that you have a choice of choice of choice is that you with every choice other choice other
And all of that other has so attractive to the cowns are like less intruly to be less attractivity is departy.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this new breeding to a new breezing new breezing of this new breet.
I turn almost always spirit.
And it was honor there was only one kind of stuff, and you know, the past, you know, the past, the past, the incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the breet, and felt the breek long enough and often enough enough to be away.
And after years I went to the wincell for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to be a stuff, this is my me."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Do you whether a rhys? Wilt you were a rhyth?
Do you want to get a brid?
Do you something explaining pipes, or flink extraordinary pipes, and so he went on.
I was talking about it. And I was talking about a while I said, "I want to get the only hold that was there to be a while,
And he had no idea which was a lot of the breezing that was, and so I have a long hours all the possible of the potential to go on all the possible of the potential to be that --
And it was quite honest, I left the winkle eventually I ended up with a very explored bit.
I had done better -- I could have done to do it better.
But I don't felt better.
Why? To this to myself, I wrote this to myself, I wrote a book of the book of it.
The reason I don't feel better.
I started without any any expectancy, because I just started a kind of spirit.
And then there are different from that there were different and one of them would be different perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I read my bird with my expectations, and that asked me tely to my expect of the time.
The more possibilities people have to have more expectations they cowest about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means people are less less fearing with results, even as the results, even as the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about now.
In the real thing is going to be about that.
Everything was bad to be,
Because when everything was bad was bad to surprising people have a lot of surprising experience.
In our modern society as well as well as a well of the forth perfection, but the best thing we can ever achieve ever achieve, is that something is so good as we were expect.
Nonce we get surprising to be surprising, because our expectations, and high high and high.
The secret of happiness -- this is to this -- the secret of happiness is not too much of happiness is not too much of happiness is not too much of happiness is not too much as a lot of happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness
I want to have a little bit -- a car biographic elementary -- that I was a woman who is really fantastic element.
I don't have a little less too.
But less enough, with less enough, have good opportunities.
And finally, when you have a bad sat at the time, you have a bad sat as there is only one kind of predictions of predicting.
The answer is that case.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different boundable, and you buy to fall, and you buy to fall, who's than responsible?
The answer to that is just so simple. That's the yourself.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different greenhouse to fale.
So if people decided to make people decisions of those decisions, even as the results of those decisions, they have been good about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clinical depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of high-time generations of high-time.
A factor -- not the enge, but it's a significant factor to this explosive increase of depression and self-killed experiencing experiencing experience are that people have been so much of their high expectations.
And if they try to explain the pointant, they are trying to explain themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettoress, so that we have been talking about it, but we feel to have to feel the present of it.
As a collabor.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be taken for where to be taken for where to be enjoying.
But that's not it.
It doesn't lose it doesn't choices can choose better is not to choose better than it doesn't automatically that more choice is more choice is more choice.
There's a magic flour. Wely, I don't know.
But I know we already for long time of the point that choices are that choices us what are promoting us well.

So the paradox that I speak to the moderne, so that I am talking about the moderne, which is that I think about it.
That's frustrated, and it's all the time. And then, you told that you were told to installer and slowed to installing kids are not helping your money.
I tell you the same about this thure, complicated choices -- they don't help to get harm. Erger they focus out to switch damage.
They make us less value.
If a part of what people in our society to make all of these choices to make all these choices that people have been transmitted countries where people have to go forward to be able to get people on it.
Also, we have to go forward.
That's what economists is a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reversion of what almost of what it is -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the choice that we have.
And finally, when you read this sculpture and you like this sculpture as a development, "Ah, what know fish is there not?
None is possible in a fish com."
A scrale imagination, a shry, a shorty, a shortany worldview,
But the longer I thought about the way to do that, I understood that this fish is the same smart.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you get the visual breeks to create potential to create opportunities, you have no freedom.
If you get the visual to create opportunities to create opportunities to create the less job of the potential job.
It leads to more dish lowing.
Everybody has a fish for a fish to it.
This is free certainly certainly -- possible even for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the absolutely of a figual fish is questions to ask is questions to ask is questions to require --
Thank you for your attention.
