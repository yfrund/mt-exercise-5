Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the policy cap, which was the pool, which was about the last three million years of the vastated Stand of 40 percent of the United Statand of 40 percent of roms.
But this particular problem because it doesn't show the nature of this specific problem because it doesn't show the ice-showing the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice-disk.
The ice skap on the North Poole, in a certain sense, sit of our global climate system.
It set out in the winter and crimped in the summer.
The next slide I showed is a acceling version of what happens in the last 25 years of happening for the last 25 years
The permanent ice is red.
As you see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the year ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
And the so-called purposmanent ice five years or older, is almost like flower, which is slightly like flower, which is sipelt here.
In 25 years of this is the way to this catch this stuff --
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozen cross-frozen Ictual warms, and there are a very large amount of womer frozen cools and then microbes that the death of microbes in methane.
And the total amount of destroyed in the atmosphere, that could be double that amount of the atmosphere.
In some indepth of the undepth in Alaska signns on from the water.
And the last winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to a different team to another ondie.
Why! She's OK. The question is right?
A reason for that, this is that this huge "warm-bron" Greenland from the north of the north of warms.
This is a melt melt river.
The water volume is the catch is larger than eye it seems
This is the Kanger-head, river, in South West Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea speats because it lands on the sea place where it is in the sea place where it comes into the sea level where it comes in the sea level of the sea.
These strains are flu.
On the other hand, on the South Pole, the largest ice mass ice ice ice mass ice ice ice mass on Earth.
And the last months reported scientists that the whole continent now that the whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly, very quickly soon with some of the underwaterland in the last,
The whole continent continent to six meters sea squire stying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two of them are now in the biggest ice mass, there are new another couple of years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is get half of his drinking water from that melt.
In the Anthen, this glestyle the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more strobs.
But when they disappears the drink water.
In California was a 40 percent in the snow, in the snowwwhek of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are predictings in the predictions are going to be severe.
This global dream of drought has read to a dramatical stying,
And the number of course, the number of course, with an incredible and never seen any single of running and never seen any speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the last 75 years.
This pattern is completely unked.
If you look at the bottom from a historic context than you can see what happens.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 --
25 mios in our oceans, every day in our oceans, Look at the eye area of the Stille Ocean, and on every single slide of Indian subcontinent, there is a drastative dalization of oxygen in the ocean.
The only big cause of warming the earth, next to deforest in the earth, which is about 20 percent of the money, is to burn for 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stepping coal is the most largest problem.
The United States, is one of the two largest excites, together with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urban centrales.
But we see a couple of the cro.
These are the coal-carbon which the bunch of the bunch of the bunch of alternatives were remostly alternatives were forgetting form astone.
There is a political stight in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industiry gave industire of 250 million dollars to promote "shrewes" stepped cool -- which is a conversation.
And that picture, I think that picture.
And the Christmas was at me at Tennessee, about four billion literally believed coolmod of gallons of the gallons of gallons
You probably seen it probably in the news of the news of the news
This is the one after one after the largest way.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooking cooking around the Kerstood was this:
Video: ""Frosty the coal man is a stay up, up, up, upon churched.
He's liquid to America, and he is in America, and he causes our economy growth of our economy.
Frosty the coal man is scone.
He's paid and estimate and copions keep their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia from the coal of West Virginia from dayan.
The largest mines of the country is the big blaunched of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship Shhome of the Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know where they talk about you about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate,
This is a piece of a ceil.
Video "BuCOALergy, we see the climate change, as a serious threatening for our business.
And that's why the reason is the most important goal is to give a gigantic engage to address the light and bring the light and the destroy of the value of stebonce of stebondness of stebbbbbbbbbbbbbbondy.
First, you know, catch is not smary.
We find that the shake is -- and it still secking.
So, you don't make worried about climate change.
Let that just about us.
Video: Actor coal, you heard a lot of carbon and you've heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shonto this hyper-carbon centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are pretty much a little bit of lawy.
But that's the sound of shone croboard technology.
Despite the fact that the breaking of steenking, one of the most important causes of the main warming the Earth, the remarkable is shaped cools that you see all over here.
Look at the time is the shone, this is the shoot carbon technology today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative of our economic challenges and that that on the area of national security.
Video: Stem: America selling in crisis, the economy, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red rate in all of these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel and imported oil.
But now there is a purpose new solution to get out of this.
For America 100 percent shapes of sheeth, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to work on the work of the work, a plan that makes us safe and the heat the warming of the Earth --
And in the way that we have a solution that reverse is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. On the tapoximate.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Itâ€™s re-in-power.
One of the fastest ways to make a end of our dependence of old burning from old follow-stoffs that our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
And they are going to be creating good jobs to create good jobs to create good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African old African old African old African old African old of that, "If you want to be all of the time.
If you want to go far up with the point of the one."
We have to go far far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back to a update about how that machine works.
So here I am the ones that don't waren't waren't waren't warenes: the largest scientific experiment ever underneath in the bit.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billions of the destroyed after the universe was began to be 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, s!
This is the machine Genee.
We took that the lead of that mini-Bangs inside detectors and this is the one where I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet AS. detector -- 44 feet in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in attacular so that you can see the scale.
And at 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that worried for a partnership in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle straight that all around the way from the LHC was going to go all around the LHC, which was boned with a piece of the LHC, which particles were flowest with a piece of the detector flowest ctor catch flowest with a piece of the LHC, which was flowing up with a photo
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September 10, we knew that the machine, which is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the largest across or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page that the Internet page of the Internet page of the way.
That means we made a both cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact of the
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was with these golden woods.
And those behaviors 13 thousand calls of crash when the machine on full power working on full power works.
The engineers will say, "Do you say, "Not true. It's too small the drad."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superago,
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, that can read the bloats that flowed the blowed of the stars of the stars of the stars, that floats that flowed the space between the stars, that flowers can be flowed by the space between the stars, that flowed the behaviors that float
In one of the connections between the nine of the nets of the LHC, was a constructive.
And it was a wire of the wire was something electric resistance against that 13 thousand climbing 13 thousand call.
This was the result.
This is even more pressed if you realize that that the magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons -- and they were about 30 inches moved in about 30 inches and about 30 inches.
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did we do.
We all have them when we all saved them.
And now they're back on the way.
Eind map the LHC again.
We will take it again, and we expect measures in june or right so that we can go further to figure out what the building building stone of the universe.
Now, of course, those unhappiness to debate again and revested the value of scientific research. It's easily.
I think the fact that it's so difficult that we go further than the value of things like the LHC.
I just showed the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to decade, I think, during the decade of the values of his students are living to define his teacher was Michael Farato, "None is something so dangerous for the human mind that we are science of science than our images of science is not the mystery in the world of science that are not new world of science that we are not going to be new new world in the world in the way of course of the world in the world in the way of the world in the wrongingingingingle of the last word that we we we we are that we are of sciencevididididididididididididididididididididdone worldone that there are that there are that there
Thank you.
I would like to start with you to ask back to your children at your children at your children at your child in blocks.
And when you discovered how to grab it up and conscious and conscious, you were actually solving problems with the teaching with and hands of space relationship with and hours of space relationship to reverse and high-ter-in-furniture relationship to deal with the teaching and hands of the teaching to go up with the way and hanging the fashion the teacher to the crowomming of the temporary relationship and hanging the frunning to solving up with the way from space and and of the engining of space relationship of space relationship of space relationship of the desistomineing of the poinevest and then then then then then then then then then when you had to be able to do
Run the world is strong amazing because with understanding the world of the world to have our him.
If an information that if an information, inspired by the nature of physical interaction with objects -- with objects -- with my advise Pattion and my compassion of Kalanithi -- what if we were to ask -- what if we would use a computer of the environmental desire to a computer that moves on a plat a plat a plat desing deep depending on a plate desquarkly desheep with objects --
and ordering we want?
And this question was so far, that we decided to find an answer to build a response of Siftables.
Cort together is a Siftable computer is an interactive computer size a cooky computer of a cooky computer of a cooky computer of a cottable computer of a cottable computer of a cow of a cow of a cooky computer of a cow of a cooky computer is a cow of cooky computer of a cow of cow is an interactive computer is a cooking.
They can be moving with the hand move each other, they can feel their movement and they catch a screen and they were a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands blocks like blocks like blocks like blocks to grab the blocks to grab the cross-down.
And the top of the top of the example of an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that this aid resources have a more physical difference, conscious of their movement and each other, and even from each other, and even of the way we move them from each other, and even of the way we move them from each other.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that catch video that is playing by the office, and others playing others and others playing other.
This interactive portraits of conscious.
Then next to each other, they will be put together, they will interest in the consider.
If they are surround, they can also notice this and can be some nervous about it.
And they feel they movement and hicles.
We realized algae that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all of the interaction, as it expanding a color as it was a fluid of color as it was a liquid of the color as it was a liquistop.
In this example three Siftables emmers for three Sifttables for color in a bunch of color in a bunch of empty in a bunch of the example,
If we have threthrethrethrethree, we went back a little bit of the back.
There are some of the crapid possibilities for education, especially play game games, and mathematics that we want to give things to give you the possibility of things quickly immediately quickly immediately sacross the outside.
So here I show this -- this is the development of a Fibonacci by a simple computation programmmate.
And here we show a game that is a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single soud letter on every Siftable, and shaped words are controlled in a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds it is very rescued a new series of letters with contribubuting possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I asked them out to try to get it out of them and make a video of it.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people don't need instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Most word and they know what to do.
Here are some other people test the test of the time.
That's our youngest bomba tester, right?
And it just like the Siftables would.
And for him this were only blocks.
Here is a interactive paintings of painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftlum with that character of the table.
Here he leaves the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good domen! Yeah! Yeah!
And by the shake of Siftables and the next to each other, he can respond to each other, he can respond to each other, and the neath of each other: Wake the nextables and the nexest of the neath of Siftables and the neath of the carda -- and the nearest of the
DM: and so his own story of the own story of the own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end an open end.
and he decided to decided to be way.
Video: The cat flying way.
DM: The last example I will show today Is a synthesizer and live music strument that we developed with a sound of sound that we developed sound as the lead, bass and pressure pressed.
Eender one of the piatic variations, where you can choose what you want to use which you want to use what you want to use
These happen in the likely Siftables so that you can determined the pattern itself to determined the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern of the pattern of themselves.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way of an owning of a very oddable effects like reverb and filter.
They are being able to claimed and added by the office,
And if the general effects like tempo and volume that are deviced on the whole pattern.
Let's see.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
And now I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now I add some slavery little bit.
Video: And now I cope the movie on the press, so I can affect live the effect of living to affect the effect of the pressed.
Video: I can cut it very cut to cut it cells the offices of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I cope the filter of the bas for the bas for the expression.
Video: I can rescue the pattern as it plays it plays playing.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything and make improvise and make very shorter like I want.
And with the same dies of the dimessage of the volume Siftable to count the left Sifting.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is to make new people from the way to make new human-computer interfaces that are better in the way our brains and body working on the way our brains and body working on the way our brains and work working on the way our brains and body working on the way our brain and body working on the way our brains and body working
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some new element in this design area that we develop in the lab.
The thought I would like to bring is that this only is the atsister to a very new generation to a very new generation of aid resources for the interacting with digital media that we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at them to talk to you with all of you all and talk to you to all of you all of you all of you all of you all of you all of you all of you all all the time.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but so much more than that.
My whole life long I've been writing for writing and I don't think that that will change.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career and career and career with my relationship with my work to re-in-in-in-forth.
It started with a book that I wrote ungs a memoire: "Ets, Biddying, Biddy," which is very very contratradiction to my first work, and an international exister and an international exist.
And the consequence is that people have to go everywhere and always told me as if I do do job.
And that -- the way -- purpos!
People come to me and questions to me and questions "Do you don't get this success that success you can never eat this succes?
And if you don't write you will be going to keep your whole life but never have a book such a book of people who will be in warm.
Do you don't frighten?"
And I was resembling and you know.
Of course, that would be very remember 20 years ago, I remember about 20 years ago, I was when I was a teenager, I was going to be writer.
People said, "Do you don't get success that you never get success to get succes?
Do you don't afraid for that you will go on on it supposed to be on it in the way to get to be on it.
Do you don't afraid you will be your life on this work without there ever something that has ever been able to die, and that you'll die, and that you'll be solid on your shooting with your mond of bitter ax?"
Something in that streting.
And in the short comes to this questions on this is going to be on this is: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all of those things that are enough.
Also, all of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things afraid, you don't know what everything that for all.
For example, for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time that come from, the last time that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically that somebody is eight to be afraid to work for which they are on Earth on Earth on Earth are see?
What is so particular about creative processes that we worry to make the effects of the mindnesses of the mindness of the mind-such work.
Take my father. He was shorting, and I can't remember that there was a remember of the 40 years he worked on the 40 years he worked on him or he was asked to him that was not afraid there for a front of it.
And so of course, "Yohn, how do it with your chemistry?"
No, if not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers by the century of the century of the century of the century of the manical depressive alcoholists to be catch a cates.
Scheat, who have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers, other creative people have been able to be the reputation of people, the reputation of people.
And if you look at the grimp death the most magnife creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by their own stycle.
And even the ones who don't seem to be suicide their gave to be under their gave to be able to catch their gave to be suicide for their gave to be suicide to be under their gave to be suicide to be suicide to be under their gave to be suicide their
In the last interview for his dead saying, "Do My each of my books is a piece of my books is a book of mitself dis."
And that's quite a bit of the life work.
But of these kind of out-we don't look at the time.
We all heard it all earlier and have heard it with all accepted with all of accepted.
The reason that the thought is that creativity is that creativity innecessary is to suffering with suffering and eventually eventually eventually lead to the misere.
So I want to ask everyone here today to ask everybody here today?
Do you do that?
Because now I think about it, I think about it, I think I don't think it all of the way to think of a little bit of thought.
I think it was a little bit of the weather shed.
And also even even dangerous.
I don't like this this century, I don't like this century,
We can be creative mind much better than we can spore a lot better than lives.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particular dangerous to that dark in that dark in the dark of the thought of life.
She was seen the phase where my career now.
And so, but I am a young am.
I can go through the decade four decade.
And so, probably everything I now will be able to be seeer by the outside world as the work that was going to be seen on that extraordinary book.
We're with friends below each other, so I can explain you -- it's probably explains my greatest success is my greatest success of me.
Just you, what an idea!
If you think of this is what you think is your mind for you know the morning, you know the front of the death of the death of the death of the morning,
So I don't want to do that.
I love lover of work I like like like the work I like like like that.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I can just come to the conclusion that I can just go through write with writing a psychological protection in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the conclusion as I can just go through a psychological protection of the concl
I have to write a securious distance between myself and my consider very understanding between myself and my confront of the reactional fear of the responsible publations.
I just just seen the last year to ways to do that.
I am in the history of the history and device in other civilizations to see or others or others to see or others have found a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search for me to the old Greeks and Romend.
And so, you know, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romen's time of the old Greeks and Rombs people didn't have creativity of themselves.
And they believed that creativity was a godd-considered spirit came from a mistake of the message and unknowledge reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable places to the humans and unknowledged for failure,
The Greeks were these calls of creativity mines of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon the word words of the word words
The Roments had a species of the same idea.
And in them was a dead of the creative mind creative mind.
The funny is that the Romen's not with a genius to be a piled person to be a pigested person to be a piled person to be a pigeat.
In their policy was a genius was a kind of magical godd-entity, which was in the walls of the artst.
And a little bit like Dobby the house of the house of the house of Dobby the house
If the artist's work, you know, assistance the geniassistance.
And he was the work.
Briljant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first time about the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work work.
The artists was so in protection to for example, for example,
If you were brilliant work, you don't get all the hall.
Everybody knew that was that an invisible genius you had helped up.
And if you were crowd, you know, I just load of you,
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genia.
Long time is that the West creativity was considered to West creativity was considered to be considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
And there was a whole new idea: the individual human human human human human human human human human is the middle of the universe and state all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the god-dline world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual lower.
And for the first time in history was there about artists there were a genius and not that they were a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius were not going to have a genius and for the first time in history of the first time and they didn't have a genius and they ha
I have to say that I think a big mistake I think a big mistake
And to make one person, one individual individual that he if she is the vehicle-hicle of the century of the century of all the didnal mystery, creative and the known forest of the equal human beings -- that's a lot of responsibility for fragimental human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in swell.
Ego's reduced to smile-claught proportions and representations to prestate expectations to prestate expectations to prestently copposed to prestate in prestate.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artist capot of artist
If that is so I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a parent old old understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relation
Maybe not.
We can running 500 years of rational, rational, not uncomposed in a 18 minutes of speech.
And probably in the audience of the audience that are reduced scientific doubt about the idea that elsewhatever crowd the idea that eless to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring the work of inspiring to inspiring the inspiring of the idea that are reflecting the idea that fashion the audience that are required.
It doesn't seem to get that I all of you in there.
And yet, I won't asked it.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that though, I don't want to get that consider?
It just focus as much as well, as all the other explanations of the totally calculated unknown incalculation that are including in the creative process.
Everybody who have to try to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so that the creative process of this -- you know the creative process doesn't always rationally rationally receving.
And that sometimes the almost paranorms.
I have the great American closer American closer Ruth Stone of the violent American closer to be moving the great American animal American closer American denominate animals.
And she's thick in the nine. Her whole life already writing them closely writing.
She told me about her childhood, on Virginia.
Some people like the field of the work was felt them, and they heard a poem, about the country.
It was so saying, like there was a big wave air came out of air came up with it.
And so that we have close golf about the country to her device as it
She felt that the ground underground her feet and knew that her at that time, but one thing to do is to do about her life.
And she ran home back home and then she had to followed as fast as quickly as quickly as quickly as fast as possible and paking paper.
When it came close by her high-wave waves her only was that her only chance to write it on the waves of writing.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then sokay, but calculate, it doesn't move house.
And at the time, the poems, the poem by her him, seeing the many of search -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her wor
And if you were a cross -- this I think I think the most beautiful part of the story -- that they were almost close to be close to be close the close to be close the beautiful part of the story -- that I think I was the most beautiful part of the story -- they were purposed to be the close of the story -- they were almost beautiful part of the story -- that they were
And then she was looking for the paper and paper, and paper, and paper the close by her hibiting her hibits.
Just at that time, she had a potless-walk up a potased to do it.
And with her other hand, so told me them, she told me the close from the air.
She was purpose close to his tail back in her body back in her body age, as she wrote the back in her body was writing.
And in that cases the close of the past was very close to paper in the paper of paper, but then in the entire way.
And when I heard I thought -- what accident, I thought of the creative process ey!
And this is the way my creative process isn't a memor! I'm not mediu!
I'm a mouthing, which every day every day on the same time chip and flower, and trans with blood, sweand trans through blood.
But even in that daily swring in the daily of experience.
You're also know it itself that feeling that creative ideas in your released released in your released by a source that you can identify impossible to identify impossible.
What is that then is that for brone?
How can we use it without we get it without a way that we are cat?
And in a way that we do do it?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A couple of years ago, I interviewed it for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a lot of his life life life was showing the shows of the crawed artists that are going to be able to get from all power to get from all the power of the unconcerned on the unconsisted in him that refriginal creative impulse in him.
And with the years of Tom a little bit of the backwarder.
And one day he was in Los Angeles about the fast road the process of radical radical.
And as he heard about that, he heard a clip, he heard a cliodie.
And the decided that does do do is destroyed inspiration that do is degrab, cwellent.
It was a beautiful meloils and he wanted to fashion the wall.
But that doesn't go to that.
He had no paper to them, no paper ecorder to be a tperecorder to be a tapot.
The well-known exciting regular record of him: "I reads the melodies and then keep it in the century backwards.
I don't really good enough, I can't be it."
He didn't get a bunch of panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new new things.
He looked up to the air and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat the law of the stuff that I sat the point of the stuver, you can see that I sat the sky and he says, "Sorry hearing, you
"Do you really think I can write a song now,
If you really want this song that this song of them come later when I have time for you've got to do for you.
And it doesn't go to anybody else catch a little bit of fall.
And then Go neighborhood, Cohen." And from that time the process of the process of course, very otherwise to be very otherwise different.
And the work itself is the same thing with the known dark subto.
But the heavy that creative process in him review that creative process in the way that he distant distance of genia.
The genius was going to close on the skin and living only only cally.
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go on and rest it to go on and rest it to go on it.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre cooperation between Tom and the property, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner aspect that not completely of Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of working changes.
I had been profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddomins. Beminning.
And at a point point I agree in despad.
You know that you don't want to work good work, but not good and you think it's a horrible disaster disaster is going to be a horrible book ook of it.
Not just just just horrible bad of them,
I wanted to do all of the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that are who who were genius who are going to be way-up with power to way.
I wended from my manuscrips and direct me to a very fun of the room.
And I said hardop, "Loke, we know all of that if this book is not just to be brilliant because of this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have everything in the way I have in the way I have in it.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you think it's better than you have to do your thing.
Snap you don't do that, you don't do that, yourself.
I just write because that's one of them because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notile of the notly.
Tja--- Utings it comes up here --
Eeuwen ago, in the North African desert people to dance with malight to dancing to dancing with malight on sacred music.
Oren and hours and hours to the morning glors.
That was always wonderful, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes happened in some of the choices something extraordinary.
One of those dancers then transcendent.
You're just know what I mean, you've ever seen something like that, you've ever seen something that in a performer.
It was like the time and the dance was the dance and dancer by a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights at it, but now I have all set together.
And suddenly he was not just a human beings a human beings for a human beings.
In him, under him blowed him glood.
A guy further across him.
If something did happen, if something happened was going to be able to clah, they were to clah, and clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God."
Because that was for them.
And by the way, a fun of historical fact, when the Moren South South Spanin, they brought this ush usual considered with them.
The extinction is the century of the century of "Allah." Allah." Allah." Allah."
And that you hear the day today in the flaments and flaments and flamental governments and flaments
If an artist in Spain something impossible, or magical does, "Allah, oil is people, oil, ooil -- oh, amazing or or or -- well, OK, well, you know, walk up."
Actually, a sician: a glimpse of God.
And reciize what we need to have to do is what we need to have
Lastig is the dance of the dance of the dance of the morning to be discovered on dinsday to discover 11 o'clock in the morning,
And at that time, he is a little bit of parenty, with review that might never get more to such a such of such will come up to such a such of such that will be going to get more to such a little bit of the parenty.
Maybe there will never be somebody God never took anybody who's dance.
What does it have to be living to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really difficult to sell creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be not to be too to.
Imagine that you don't go from the most unusual aspects of your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from you.
Imagine if you believe them a while, you have seen them a while to be more more sources of a source.
When you are ready with it, they get through someone else in someone else.
And so it was considered everything.
I hang intools that thought of the dad of the dad
The last months I've been working on a book that will be short solid to be shining a lot of removing to be removed to be checked out to be checked out of the last months.
The operating that illuster progress.
If my mind thoughts with me on the doze, I keep the same for: I keep the same forest of the same one.
Do just you work.
And if you just do thing you do and what it is.
If you are too dance you will dance to dance.
If the god-consider genius is destincluding in your work at some time at some time of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the work,
And if you don't have that dance dance but continue.
And then "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that I believe that.
"Oly!"Well, the same thing because we stay human love and propertly, we keep staying and propertly, by plumness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Or.
You know, I had had been talking about some of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that means mean, and what it means of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point: we were the biology to digital biology to the digital code to a new phase of the digital code in the biology and synthetancy of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions of the big questions
"What is life?" is something that I think about a lot of biolos have tried to understand the way to understand in different levels of the levels of the biologists have tried to understand the whole of bioloos.
We tried different approaches to minimal approach to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years of digitize the digitize
And when we have sequenced the human genome genome of the biology, and it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask to ask life regenerate, or can we create life creating out of this digital universe.
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can be a kind of that itself can be multiply in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get a nature smaller genome for a little smaller genome of the genome.
We can catch in the order of hundred of them out of the 500 or who's there.
But if we look at the metabolan map, which is relatively simply compared to the insult of the inso.
And I believe me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch a piece of the genes that it would be very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell cell cell that we can switch,
And we decided that the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions. So we could catch the components to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we started a chromosome chromosome chromosome of synthetthet?"
Staat the chemistry to make these very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, if we do that, a chromosome of the cromosome of the one?
One chromosome is just a little bit of chemical including material
So, our tempo of the digitize of life is accelerating exponential wished.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather rather slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly of the catch code of the engineering.
And our last point it would put on this moment on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago,
There were some stages for a couple of stadishes with a bio-ethical departnership on the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesize of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult --
There are teenthousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in lenging, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it pieces of the world -- the more falts.
So we had to make a new method for the collaborate of these little pieces and corrigerate of all the wrong of all the wrong of all the wrong of all the wrong of these little pieces of little pieces of the wrong of these little pieces and corrigerate of all the wrong of these little pieces of little piec
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria that bacteria die.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the bout-correction,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part when we put a little bit of chemical chemical stust in the bacteria and the bacteria genetic code the genetic code and virtually shares and virtually shares and virtually shares were making out of the bacteria --
The viral particles were going to be losed when they were cells, they came back and killed the E. coli.
I was in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that they catch model but all to be good fastly well.
They laugh more than you.
So we think this is a situation where the software is building the software can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosquit.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassets in cassets in cassetts that we could experience the cassetts of various --
to understand what the actual components of a living cells of a living cell.
The design is critical crity, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that need to be very digital information in the computer than that are digital information in the computer than to be very digital information in the computer than the computer than the computer than to be very accuraate.
When we first had this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard of the standard of a 10,000 basepares.
And eventually we found after resequence, if we had 30 falts. If we had the original sequence than it was not in strong.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters that are 50 letters that have to overlapping with all other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can design and build to build so that they can get together.
We design unique parts in this way.
Maybe you read that we put water set out of the watermarks.
Bet, I think we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, Go and T.
Trios of those letters code for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a bunch of them to every aminoxi.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, single in the way.
And so we just catch a catch of signment.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no pursue pposed to push pursue of the poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they and put them and together.
And we started to make pieces of pieces that pieces that were five to 7,000 letters that were five to 7,000 letters for 24,000 letters of each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stadium we got a robd of these pieces so that we could sequences them because we could create them because we want to create them very robuy -- that you will see straight you see straight -- that you will see straight them from the straight of these pieces so that we could sequences them because we could sequences them sequences to create them very robuy them -- that we could
We try to get the point of automatiseration.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as soon as we get to get the big pieces -- more than 100,000 based-partnership -- they don't grow so easily more in E.
And that explains the most of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
So we went to read to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolog recombination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repairs that pieces of DNA cates.
Here is an example,
There is an organism called Deinoccus radio durans that three million radiation of radiation that three million radiation of radiation
And that you see that in the top panel, set up in the top panel, just set out of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he put it back into each other, and exactly like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be dried up.
They can live in a vacum.
I know absolutely sure that there is life in space that can prevent that can prove a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is many of the way, there is many of it,
Here is a demicrophones that we did with this process that we made with this processes -- including with this processes -- actually, with only yesterstern mechanisms with the right design.
And so that they put automatically care crazy.
This is not an electron-microscope, this is a wire microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope of light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we extend to extend to be extended on
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, and then 142 pages to pressupport the genetic code down.
Well, how do we started, how do we started chromosome? How do we have it?
And with a virus is clearly pretty easy.
And with a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you your eukaryots, like us, you just whether just the cell and do another another in and do another in, and that's what you know when it being.
And in the bacteria is the chromospher, but we have integrated in the cell, but we have recently showing that we have a full transpllantation of a chromosquito of a cell transplant to another other, and can activate the cell to another other, and we can do it.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microromosome species.
These are about so far from each other, as people and moving and muizen.
We added some extra little bit so that we could select for this chromosome of chromosome of this chromosome.
We have it to make all the eggs to make all the eggars.
It was quite sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very cell of the cell images here -- the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
We even thought it would come to sover the process of what we were going to be developed to develop the process of what to do is moving to be moving out of the process of moving to come out of the process of moving to come up to the she'd be able to move the process of what was further to develop the process of what to be going to be able to moving out of the process of what to come out of the process of what was going to come out of the process of the process of the process of the process of process of proc
This is an essential evolutional evolutionism.
We discover all sorts of kinds of of these chromosome of chromosome of them or a third of it, or a third thousands of ownerships in one time, which they add a second chromosing in one time of them in one time in one time,
People who evolution evolved as if there are one in the same same as if there are not a lot of biology have been been given biology
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes that are actually enough, which are actually reversy.
The chromosphere. It was not going to have not eat.
The cell -- the chromosome of it, we put in it,
It was expression, and the recognized the other chromosome of strange as strange material, and so we eventually had the cell of the new chromosophicky.
He was blue because he was blue the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the characteristics of all the characteristics of the one species of the new species of based in the new software that we in the cell we in the cell cell.
All the proteins changed membranes -- when we changed the genetic code was changed the genetic code was changed.
This is a main the software alchemistry, but we are in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally fundamentally changes.
Good, I've been paying that this is not a creation that this is not a creation of a farming of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid that we may almost a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion where there are big scale new species of new species of species that there are a new new species of new species of the Cambrance design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly when you look at what is needed is.
We're going to be so-and-a-half billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 460 years that there are four armed in 40 years that there are four there.
We have distincluding the care of clean water, medicine, medicine, drugs for the six-and-a-half billion.
And that is hard to do that for now.
We use five billion tons of collapsed over 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 miloons of freedom of a day.
When we take biological processes in the ogency or what process than to replace that to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, all of the carbon dioxide of the stine that is really coming in the atmosphere.
And by the way, we have discovered discoveries now we have a databas, and I would like to think of about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dead different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of that.
We are prestinctions by an organic reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques thanks to do so-called synthesemethods to do so on "combination genomics to do something called combination genomics.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes, or try to get processes or tries to make octan octon or to produce octon or medicines or medicining to produce cine, we can change with a small team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for living vaccine, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design, and what real designs that we work on the computer and go to work on the computer and a new kind of on the computer can design a new kind of on the computer can design a new kind of on the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer can design a new kind of on the computer can design of the computer can design kind of a screen of a screen of a screen of the things that can actually get to work on the computer of a new kind of a new kind of a new kind of a new kind of thing that we can design of thing
We don't know what it will see.
We know how their genetic code looks like.
We four generation now four generation now fuel now,
On the foundly have seen founding, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation srifying that will come in from sugar, as sugar, more high-digiter fuels like occasional casump or of butano.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence is that the food support and the availability to relaunch, and the available is when we start with CO2 as his food and so we are celling cells to design that ways, and we think we can do the first fourth generation that we do the first fourth generation of the first fourth of months.
Snonlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwide, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the depth, about 2.5 miles deep, with coking temperature of temperaturies.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy sources as energy sources.
We're looking at the way or we can take CO2 and we can take a pipate of pipes that can be removed to factory the CO2 to fround this process to set this process to fuel this process to set this process to four.
So in a short time slide of a short of time we are able to break out on the basal question: "What is life?"
We actually have a real, you know -- the available to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED where then you can do this?
A important energy source of energy source.
But we also work on the way from these tools to think about quickly servaccines of vaccines to think.
This year was the flu -- we always walk up the fluming the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that changes from textomorrow vaccines
And here you see how the future can see the future can see the evolutionary now changing evolutionary now changed evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are more distant from people's improving people.
Our goal is to assume that we make an opportunity to survive for a long enough to survive that welf. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a first time, is the fundament of a new technology that we were to bring a new technology that we were to bring a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a surroundation where you locally or on distance with immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at the digital images here in digital images and can keep on here on the side of in-- and except the including and the sorts of our wish-went.
And it doesn't matter how much information we have to look at how big these collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera pictures, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel of the Librance of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of them are about the L
It all makes not all matter because the only thing the prestations would affect the amount of of the way that the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book an example of non-picture.
This is the gradual house by Dickens. Each colupper is a chapter piece.
And to prove that it is really textest is and not a picture, we can do something that we can do something that is really text to show that this really text issue.
And maybe this is a little bit strange of strange way to read a hush book in the e-book way to read a hush book of a book way to read.
I wouldn't add it.
This is an example. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big picture is the beginning of an underlevel of the substantial crowd.
This is really a fun, and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper of time whether is actually a scaling medium is.
We also have something with the corner of this extensive of The Guardian.
We made a nor adverse of high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertion -- and we have extra information -- and we have extractly instead.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car and you see it.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen through the screen of hands through the screen of hands,
We hope that this doesn't mean that means more, and other third flawwwking, not need more needed to be more more than needed to be more than needed to be more pop-ups and other third of the blaul of them -- not needed to be more pop-ups of the flaul -- not needed up to be more pop-ups
Of course are landcards for the hand the entire application for a technology like this, I will spent a technology like this, I will spent a time to spend up with this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And put on top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Webb; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, which two techniques two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision research, promoderly computer by Noah Snavely, promoting Washington, by Steve Seitz at U.W.
and Rick Sri at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see that we can see through the pictures and the multi-resolution resolution and the multi-resolution.
The space shake of the images is here is meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images together so they were cut to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized diassions of diassistabilized diassistance diassive images.
I don't know if there is a time or there is other environments.
There are a lot of space counternature that are more space.
I want to like one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we working on the environments -- to the communicate what I have in my head is the realm of this technique, in the environments of this technique, in the environments on our website.
We had to keep account with the lawyers, and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with pictures from Flickr. You just seeking Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and so on.
And each of these orange chain, a picture again, which is a picture again, which was part of this model of this model of model that was part of this model that was part of this model again.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are copied in this way of copied by the way,
And we can take a simple way way to navigate
You know, I never thought I would never work, I ever thought I would ever work.
It's overwhelming here is so device.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras is cameras is to mirrors to mirrors a lot of third reflexcameras a bad cating.
I will try to find some strange some strange images.
There are so much of them by faces and so much by faces and so on.
And somewhere between this is even a series of pictures -- here they are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also chose chured by the program.
If we diverse through the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say things with the social environment. This is now the data -- from the whole collective memory of the entire collective memory -- and heading that everything else on each other.
All these pictures are considered with each other, and shake together a little bigger than the shared of the parts.
And you have a model that from the entire Earth is all the Earth
As this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the work of the work of the Earth.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it when they use it as well, and the prevent of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are prevent to metapa data that somebody else inved.
If somebody all of these heads and their names and their names and their names and their names is rich raised to be agreement with all of those data, and I can use as a access to all those space, which is using metap-versus and created with all of the photographs, and created with this cross-model, and created social experience.
And of course, the be-product virtual model of virtual model of every interesting virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, which not only only photographs, satellite images and other applications is destroyed from the collectively memory.
Thank you so much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that some of your software possible on a day, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are dealed by everyone in the world can copple in the world together in the world can copy together in the world together in the next years, and all the images that some of your software possibly years, all the images that some of your software possible in the next years, all of the images that you can cope of the things that are are in the world in the world in the next years, in the next years, in the next years, of all of the next years, and I can I can I can I can I can do is is is that are going to understrong is that make
BA: Yeah. What this is discovery.
It creates your wish-your wishs, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the base of the data in the images.
And that is decreated exciting when you think think about the richchchales of semantic information which is describe a lot of these images are available to have a lot of excellent.
When you look for images, you feel a searching of images, you feel a searching bpage of information is far about what the image is about what the image represent.
What if now is that pictured image of your images?
Then are the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth rich that comes from that comes from that comes from that prevent that comes from that is a classes.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasure and of evily research is the possibility to live in the life between the ancient of life that are not forget to live in the wind, which are feeling their past.
The science that Jaaguar-shamans still traveling the Milky Way or that the myths of Inextincent meant with meaning meaning or the Himalaya bird hundred of Dhar, remember of Dhar, you remember really is the depeneded on the anthropology that we live in an absolutely life in an absolutely of the reality, but is not a smodel of the reality, but is still one of the working on the front of the working on the Mush still is still of the other thing about about about about about about the way of the other thing that we still of the other thing that we still is still is still is still is still is still is still is still is still
the consequence of a pervalent set approach to our ancestors that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same adapted requires of the world. Brenrenges children in the world.
We all make all insophistic.
Actually, the intest disheping through the dead.
So it can't be surprise that we all of them, and dancing and art.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the ritm of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or that is the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the U.ood-Sii or the U.ood-Cur, or the freeders in the Kaisut devoice in North Kenya, the Curother's Curanother's Sahar. Canother's Sahara. This is the Sahara. This is the devoid of the desert of the desert of the death, or a maago, or a mama,
Everest, the godin-mother of the world.
They all us us us all that we can think of us are different from the earth can think, difference on Earth can be able to think.
If you think about it, this idea of it, you can only give you hope to give you hope.
Samen the intelligentable cultures in the world of spiritual and culture, that the planet and culture, and the the way to make the biological life webb, and the biological life webb, the biosweb,
This cultural life clifeweb you can imagine as an event.
The foot nosed of defining when the totally the total of all the thoughts of all the thoughts, dreams, and inspirations and inspirations that are prevent by the human conscious since the beginning of our consciousness since the beginning of our consciousness.
The etnosed is the big nalature of humanity.
And she's symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as amazing newset of new new animals.
And like the biosphere is what touched is the eat, the eat, and even in much larger mate.
No biologist, no biologist, and that least half of all the species of all the species on the point of extinct state from extinct.
And the most apocalyptic scenario for cultural scenario for the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing of this is paths.
And when everybody here was born to be born six-thousand of languages on Earth.
A language, is more than her word whether her grammatical rules.
A language is a coppses.
It's the vehicle that the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Every language, is a century mind, an ecosystem to spiritual contemporary of spiritual opportunities.
And from that six-thousand of languages today the day of that not more fluid in children are fluistent.
They don't get babies longer tell.

They can only be none of orturning to something that the monoamine of suspends on effect.
The fascinating is that the catch of the limb of the limble combined monoa monoamine suppressing the tryptamin-suppressing the tryptaminy of 80,000 plants of two morph-follow?

Genocide, the physical excise of a people, universally distinction of the life of a people, but destroy of the livity of a people, but in many areas even four lifeed as part of a developmental strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level on the basic level of touching level.

And finally, it comes up on a choice.
Would we live in a gray world of a gray world or we want to live a colorful world of diversity?
The big anthropologist, Mead said to her dead that she was peace that we direction, amorf worldview that we direct a general crowd worldview.
We wouldn't see the human imagination of imagination constently thinking, but we would have to meet and forgotten that we would have been defined and forgotten that there are other options.

If the intelliligentles, the world is to assign of people, and they responsibility to 10,000 different voices.
And it is that song that we will discover the opportunity to be discover what we are going to be what we are, which is a full species that that is all the flowers to make all the sets of optimism. There are large moments of optimism.
This picture I have taken on the northern of Baffin Island taken up with Inextended to Inextended to Inextended to Inded.
This man, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inextended in the 1950s, to following our sout, to fast our sout, in the 1950 --
The ones of Olayuk read.
The family peace for his life and menam all his his head, all his his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inuit not afraid for the colles; they use use it.
The slides of their sleeks were made from their sleeks in fish in caribs.
Olayer was not afraid for the policy or the storm that was the storm that was removing the storm that was remember.
He went out to outside, he was living sout, and he was pooked in his hand. And then he started to freezing the poop began to be freezing the poop began to be a liming.
He brought a low-to-century on the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the wheat the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the way.
And when it was solid, he was a dog of them.
He met the dog and improvised a harnails.
And from the ribbs he made a bad thing.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood, and he disappearing on the ice flake, including poems.
And this is not going to be set around the world. And this, in many ways, symbol for the weather of the Inin and all the income of the Inin and all the infront of the world.
In april 1999 the Canadian government the Inin the entire infrom a piece of country larger than California and Texas saming our new home. It's called Nunavut.
It's independent. They are all regions of all the sown.
It's a amazing example of how a nation enough enough enough to bondy.
And finally, I think it's clear, I think it's clear, at least for who is at this home to these home of the world is really, that they actually don't get away from the world of the world --
They're somebody who are somebody country.
And they are at the beginning of human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, just like the unfollowing of these kids, like the unfree of hope.
And what we finally do at National Geographic, is extended to be reaching the idea that politicians never reached anything that politicians never reached anything that politicians never reached anything we finally do about anything that politicians never reach.
We think that polemics -- we think that a polemic, but we believe that stories are tellers to tell the world the world that we probably probably the best storytellers in the world that we probably are the best storytellers in 156 million times a months of TV and mabebegazines a millions of public.
We make a fell following to the eat, with our event, with our public, to such extraordinary places, where the toeshibited so ideny ivoted by what it seeing -- hopefully for the most important barreling the most important baring the anthropology will be able to live in a multicultured that we can find a way that we can find a way to live in a multicultiulticultural world and pluralistic world
where all the wisdom of all the people, can contribute to our semental well-well-behaviors to our consult well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question of some question that I have been a book of a book of the question.
Maybe you see paralls with information of other sources from other sources.
I also try to explain some sense that you might have been taking you might have been told you might have been catch a little bit of you might be debited to be a bully.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma, industrialized society.
And that official dogma, as a follow-set as follow-set of our citizens, on the highest level of our citizen's level as much as possible individual freedom of the freedom.
Freedom is a large good good at the time, an essential part of the human exist.
And the top dies are freedom to do to do to do a higher more more well-wal-making in-in-clude well-in-in-third.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice, we find in choice.
More choices love in that people are freedomination.
And more freedom means automatically more well-well-of-freedom means
This is so deep diving in our society that no one would be returned to be doub.
And in our lives is this dead is this dead deft for a celebration.
I will give you some examples of our modern choices of our modern choices
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
And at the time, at the 175 changes, there are threats in my supermarket 10 different extra-virgin oil and twice phoil and twalf different ballize.
And so that you can make a tiny of your own thressions for the case between 175 species for yourself.
So that's the attacked of my supermarket.
Look at electronics you can get your stereoset your stereoset -- loud speakers, cassettesple of them --
And if you can see one electronics you can choose from this number of attacks.
You can put together six and a half million different systems, with parts of parts from that wine.
Like -- then you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
And when I was young you could have all sorts of phone services but only at Ma Bell.
You home the device. You couldn't bought it.
And that had the way, that the advantage that it had never soon to go.
And that time is fore."
And in the way that are a lot of different across of different across
And in order to cell phones is immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-player, neushers and cracy break fun of them break break break of them break break of them -- that with the mire -- that with mulry.
And if you don't have seen this model that model in the wincle in the wincle that happens to be solid that happens.
The follow: people come to the wincle and assume this question.
And you know how the answer that question.
No,
It's not possible to buy that cope that doesn't do too much of doing.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attackle of stuff, this explosive increasingly increasing choices a fact.
And the U.S. is not the tools in the U.S. inhind the doctors that you go to the docket and that you have to dock the doctor.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A doctor, or we can do But, or we can do But, or we can do BBy Br.
A has this front and navy,
By has this moves, and nadel. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what do you find it?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front and navy, and Bose has this front and navil.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was doing?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you feel you."
And we call that "own input of the patient."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision of decide decide of things -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor is not the best condition to take decision to take decision to take decisions -- the patient. For on advances are much adoptions of adopternal reline is made much more adopstinctions of degree is made much much more resisted to destant to make a lot of decidentinclearlies of the best best best best of decisifying of dec
And I think that I think that I think that because the goal's far, you don't buy and I cannot buy them.
Why adopting, if we can't cope them?
Because they think we think we are going to do our doctor our doctor to ask that other market measure reverse.
Our identity yet a ratch of our exists are now over, now is now overbulling on choices like you can see on this slides on this slides of our exist.
Our identity is loss of our background.
We like ourselves -- so often we just want to get ourselves --
Every single morning to be considered to think what person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage of marriage, the family.
There is a time that you know, there was a time that you were automatically from the way, you could be so fast as quickly, and then so fast as quickly.
The only realm was the only choice was with why, not when and what you did.
Now free everything is to catch the way.
I left to extract students, which I would give me double students, which I have done less househwork than early housing.
They are not the him or in the early of the early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices
"Would I like to follow or now?
Or I will wait? Do I first children, or do I first children, or a career or a career or a care?"
These are all set of questions.
They go through to them through an answer, if this means that they don't have their houswork and then no good catch numbers and then no good cates.
And they have the same life-questions.
And then we get to work. Carl just all that technology us is to work that technology is to work every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every day.
There is one place, by the way, which I love measure I like like WiFi it does do it.
I don't think I think because I want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choices of work that we are getting in that we are getting out and asking up and then on time, or we go to work, or now.
We can look at a footballadefying our son on the one hand, with our sone, and our Blackberry on one hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our laptop on the other hand.
And even if they all get from straight from the minute of those measures of the things like that, "Am I ask this phone, "Am I responsibilit?
Is I like this emailing for this hush measure? Am I write this letter --
And even if the answer "Nee" is, we experience the football distinct of our son in a very different way.
And what we also look at the large, the small, materialistic things are living styl: life styl: life is a question.
And so the world looked like the world early looked like this.
There were some choices but not everything was a choices of choos;
And so the world looks at the world.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad?
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what is good about is that there is good about what is is bad about what is is bad to it.
That huge choices has two effects, two effects, two effects, two effects, two effects, two effects,
And a very contradictouch effect is that the earlier than free is the earlier.
And with so many choices people find the distincluding a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of that, a research of investments in volunteer volunteer plans.
A colleague of me got access to investment data from Vanguard, a big policy created members with about one million employees with about 2,000 fingers.
And they discovered that for every degree of any degrees that took the worked on the worked on the worked on the worked two percent of the works.
And in five percent of the farming of them are less employees than in five percent less employees than five than five than five than five so?
Because it at five-far, and so on.
And from exposed to be destroy."
That doesn't mean that people after their pensionate, not only they have no dry bread because they don't have enough money because they have enough money because they have been seeing the choice knowledge that they have been working for a lot of partnership for them to shoot for dessed.
And they were going to go to 5,000 dollars a year of their nose.
The worked was catch to double their own contribute to double.
And so many choices can be working on the way to work
And I think the world is sick out of it.
If it goes to the century of the century is you like to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be surprised with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
And that's the first effect. The second effect. The second thing that we had the lost of our dishaped and choose square and eventually lower than the case of the result than it would be when we had fewer options of the case, if we had fewer options were feeduced as we had fewer options of the way.
And there are multiple reasons for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, from from ttallowed that the choice was not perfect.
You assume that you put in a case, that a other choice would have been better in the sense of the case that would be a case for a other choice for that a other choice for a other choice that would be better choice for a case of the choice for a case of the case that would be a case for a case of case that would be a case of case for a c
This dreamed alternative is to get your choices of your choice.
And then does set down, the follow-cost of the choice that you have made even if it was a good choice.
The more options are there to be a single more options of unaway from the gets of unaway of the gecosts option.
Secondly, a second reason with substitutional costs.
And then Gilbert gave the morning, all of how often we depend the value of things we are compared to be with the things that we equal them.
If you can think of many alternatives, you can see many alternatives of all the alternatives of all alternatives that you demostly destroy that you demost.
And that makes you fewer task with the alternative that you have costs of alternative that you have costs
A example, the non-New Yorkers underneath you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is on vavolcan, in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second wound.
They are in a wonderful strand. Straling weather. No weather.
Don't be the right? "Do you think of the gustome, "It's augord.

And he is two weeks, with the idea that he was a great parking for every day again every day of a great parking place.
And the substitutional costs that we have our choice of our choice that we have a great choice, even if we make a wonderful choice.
The more possibilities, the more possibilities, and more attracted alternatives.
And those presenting us as substitutional costs.
One of the example.
This image stories to some points.
Like in the right here, and for example, and you don't have to get things to get away to get things like that.
And one point is that you can do with every choice other choice,
And all that other has so attractions that are cooperiod option the cooperiod option is less attrack.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this for my searching for a new bbreeding for a new breeding of a new breeding of the new breet.
I was always speaking almost always speak of it.
And the bird was only one kind of stuff -- and you cough, and you couldn't be the past, it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you catable, but if you were the breeding the blow-by-up and often enough enough and often enough it was unbelievil.
And after years I went to the wincle for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to reb, this is my mem."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Do you or a crit? Would you be stone-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed or acid?
Do you have a bird with slip?
And if you cut something extend to pit or flink out of pitting." And so he went through it.
I was spoke of the one-time I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want the only work, who was the only work,
He had no idea which was adapt, and so I have an hour for an hour for an hour for an hour for an hour for an hour for an hour for an hour for an hour for an hour for an hour for an hour hours of the engine of the hour for an hour for hour for an hour for an hour your hours of the hours of the environment.
And it was quite honest, I explain the wincle eventually eventually with a bunch of breedomb.
I had been doing better than I could do better do it anything that possibilities I could do better do it.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Well, to explain this room itself out of myself out of a book of a book of the book of the book of the book of the book of itself.
The reason I don't feel better with all of that choice, was that I started expecting to expect the clucky of a good speak of a good speak of a good speaking.
I started without any any expectancy, because I just just one kind of speaking of a speaking.
And then there were different wars, and one of them would be fast perfect.
And what I bought was good to be perfect.
And so I read my job, I was my expectations, and that asked me teleur.
The more possibilities people have expected more expectations to be cooking about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that people are less fewer stomers are less fewer of the results are more than the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about that.
And in the really is about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse by, people could have a lot of raised experience.
In our modern society as well as a well-sense citizens, but the best thing we ever reached perfection, is that something so good when we had ever reached as well as we expected to expect as well as we had to prepared as well.
Never we ever ever resurprising because our expectations, my expectations, torengaged to be high-high-up.
The secret of happiness -- this is for you all of you all of you have all been expected to be expected much expected to be expected much expected to be expected much expected to be expected to expect a lot of happiness is not too much of happiness is not to
I want to have a little bit -- a car biographically elementally -- I was by by a woman who is really fantastic element.
I didn't ask her to less too.
But with less enough takes are good opportunities.
And finally, when you sit is a bad bad bad as you can get a bad of predicting, but one kind of predicting, you can ask you destintished why you cut destate.
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsibil. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bones are available to be a who's turns out to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple. That's just so simple.
You could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different jobs to failure.
So if people decided to take people decided even if the results of those decides are good to be good degrees about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clinical depression in the younger generations of the younger generations of higher.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive increasingly explosive and suicide self-suicide factor of depression experiencing experiences from high expectancy.
And if they try to explain themselves, they try to explain themselves, they care the decade.
So the nettoresulat is that we spoken objectively on the level of it, but our bad feeling the bad of the catch feeling of the catch of it.
And just a sheep.
This is the official dogma, that by everyone is that by attacks.
But that's not.
It doesn't suffering that is no doubt that is better than not able to choose is not automatically that more choices more choice.
There is a magical flying of choices that I don't know that I don't know that.
But I know that we are for a long time of the point that choices us well-well-well-well-to-well-to-right.
Now there is a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best one.
The choices in industrialized countries comes from material overfluence.
There are many places on the world, we have heard about what we have heard about where the problem is not so much more choice, but right now, but right now.
So the paradox I speak to the modern, so that I think about the modern, well, well, well,
That's frustrated, and I think about this, if you have yesterday you have yesterday you told that expensive and satch kids are not helping children's sat your money. She of your money. Shw of your money.
I say you the same about this couple of thuic, and they don't help nothing that they don't help now: they switching to shad.
They make our lives less value.
If part of what people in our society is contained to make all of those choices that people have been overbehaving to countries where people have to get the life of those people have to go forward to get out of those people on it.
And so our lives would go on on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reverse by reverse -- not only poor people -- and that comes from the choices that we with our device that we with our with our device that we get with our way.
And finally, if you read this image story of the image story of like a developed of human as developed and say, "Ach, what fish is there nothing of the fish of the things like that.
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scral imagination, a shrulal imagination, a short worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it, I think about it, I understood that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you get the fishing to create the fish crosses, you don't have freedom, you don't have freedom.
If you get the fish crazy to create possibilities, you get less too, you get less too.
It leads to more lose and less raterness and less ratisfied fortunately,
Everybody has a fish.
This is free to limit -- possible even for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the suspendence of a figure-fishing questions to say -- and distinct.
Thank you for your attention.
