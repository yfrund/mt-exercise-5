Last year, I showed these two sdias, to show that the polar cap, which was the past three million years of the size of the U.S. had 40 percent of the U.S. by 40 percent percent percent percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the next thing to do is a specific problem because it doesn't show the dic of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice climate on the North Pole is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It set out in the summer.
The next slide I showed is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is purpose in red.
As you see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the year ice ice during the winter.
And the crinky in summer.
The so-called se-se-se-year-old or older, is almost like blood, that is from the body sillows, which is from the body to the body else and
In 25 years is it from this to this forward this to this for.
And that's a problem because the frozen freound around the Northern Icelerating and there a very large amount of carbon in a very large amount of carbon is that when it was death, by microbes in methane.
Consider to the total amount of distincluding in the atmosphere, that could double that could double that can double if we describe the battledge the point of display to difficult the amount of display if we write the amount of display to dddness the case of atmosphere,
In some undeep, in some undeep, in Alaska signs on from the water.
Fast winter went Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different undeep on a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a deep deep deep deep on the U
Why! She's OK. The question is the question is to be that we will be that will be that we will be that will be able to be that we will be able to be that we will be that
A reason for that, is that this huge "warm" Greenland from the north of Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of "warming Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the north.
This is a meltwaterr.
The water volume is the far volume is a bigger than it was a bigger than it was a bigger than it was a bigger than it is.
This is the Kanger-suam in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea soaged because it landijes the landics mely, this is the place where it comes in the sea.
These little little bit.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, the largest ice ice mass icemass on Earth.
And for the last month, scientists reported, scientists that all continent,
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole is very quickly to the south of the underwater eillands.
The whole continent, the whole continent, sea salt stying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice ice ice mass, there are new notics, who were still glaciers were still glaciers were still glaciers
40 percent of the world's population is gets half of his drinking water from that melt.
In the Andes, this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more powerful stroms.
But when they disappears out the drink water.
In California was a 40 percent in the snowe of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are read at the predictions are survey.
This global dreams of the dream fields of foresting forest fuels.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never several and never seen face speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unentirely unentry.
If you look at the boards from a historic context of what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 piled every 24 hours,
25 miles in our oceans, and you look at the easter, look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, and each side, and on each side, and on each side, there is a drastic dalation of Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic dalation of oxygen in the oceans.
The only big cause of the Earth, next to deforestation, which is to deforestation, which is to 20 percent of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and coal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding China.
And there was a lot more coal to build a lot more coal-carbon carbon centrales.
But we see a cirmess.
These are the coal-carbon which the board of the bigger in the last years, and where green alternatives were advantages.
There's a political fighting in our country.
The coal carbon -- and oil industire gave years to promote "Con" spring coal coal coal coal coal of promoting a contrary of the contradiction is a conversation.
And that image did something to think about something like this.
And the urban was at home in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion gallallons of literally believable.
You probably have seen the news in the news.
This is the one after largest waste power in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertisements of the cost cooking on the Kerstront of the Kerstest was these.

He's overliquid to America, and he causes to America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coal guy is scann to the day
He's paid and cute employee."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia from day's choice.

We find that the clean -- and it still seems at a bull.
So, don't worry about climate change --
Let me go to us on the way to us.
Video: Schone coal, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-modern clean coal-coal-coals.
Fantastic! The machines are pretty much lower to make a little low.
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.
In spite the fact that the fires of coal of one of the most important causes of the most important causes of the Earth, changing the shooting shoobly shones technology that you see here.

Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am a little of those who don't waren't waren't one -- the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever undernenearly enterrible experiment ever in the end.
It has to be the circumstances that were attack than a billion second after the universe started after the universe started started to 600 million times a second a second after the universe started to 600 million times a second times a second after the universe started to 600 million times a second after the conditions to be a second after the conditions to be able to 600 million times a secon
Enorm ambitius, set this!
This is the machine Geneee.
We took pictures from that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one where I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in argue so you can see the scale.
And in 10 last years, we put the machine for the first time,
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That caused to be a partnership.
It's a picture of the first particle of party, which was all around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, value with a piece of the LHC, valvalue in the detector of the detector of the detector of power.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that worked the machine worked in a huge overcome a huge over-infall.
I don't know if this the biggest approach, or this, when someone to Google and saw that the Internet page, and saw that the Internet page,
That means that we made a cultural as a science of impact as a science impact --
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to do with these golden wetom.
And those wears of thousand thousand of a thousand of a thousand of them working at full power.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's not true. It's too small drams."
They can do that because they can do that because they are super-a-temperature temperature --
So on min 271 grades, colder than the space between the stars, that can be able to reach the power that power ago.
In one of the connectivity between nine of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive of the LHC, was a constructive in the LHC, was a constructivating.
And it was a little wire something warmer, and it was invented to that 13 thousand thousand thousand thousand of them
This was the result.
This is even more impression if you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons and they were about 30 inches in the way.
We were hard to about 50 magnets.
We had to figure out of it, what we did it.
We all have repairs.
Now they're back on a road.
Eind map the LHC will be again.
We will take it back and we expect measurements in june or juicians, so we can go further with what the building of the universe.
Now, of course, they have started accidents the debate reinsances the value of scientific research. It's easily to reject the work.
I think the fact that it's so hard to be so hard to go beyond than the LHC.
I just show the last words on English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would have been able to do the value of the value of the value of his student was Michael Farage, Michael Farage, "Nthing is so dangerous for the progress, and that our images our images of human mind than to the human mind that there are no new in the natural world and that there are no new new to the world's require, and that there are no new in the world of natural world and discushead of natural world and that there are no new new new way of scientthing that there are not to discdiscdiscdiscdiscdiscdiscdiscdiscussident that there are not to discestimpiry new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
Thank you very much.
I would want to start to asking you to ask you to go back to your children at your children play.
When you are, how to grab it up, and they crived and conscious, you actually solve problems through the environmental relationship to resolve through the next, and the high-relationships and tering the hands of space relationship to solve with the international relations.
Rumtelevision is very powerful to understand the world to understand the world to us
If a information that is inspired by the physical interact with objects -- and with my advise Pattion and my flaw Pattion and my compassion and my compassion Jeeby Kalanithi -- what if we would have a computer -- what if we were to ask a computer that some kind of digital finger as a kind of digital finger like a digital fingertop of what individual information would be to be to fropiddle information with physical physical fishead information
and can ordering order?
And this question held us so that we decided to look at a single answer by building Siftables.
Cortation is a Siftable computer size a computer size of a cotttery of a cotttery of a cotton.
They can be moved with the hand, they can get each other, they can get their movement and they contain a screen and wireless contact and wireless contact of the contact of the wireless and wireless contact with the hand wireless to the hand wireless the hand, and they can contain the hand, and they can contain the hand, and they can get a screen and they can get them to get each other,
The nuclear understanding is the physical handlevel of blocks as blocks like blocks from it.
And the most of the Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem for ways of digital information.
And this is that these helping resources have a more physical difference, and even of their movement and even of the way we move to discover and fun interactions of explortic interactions to discover and fun interactions of explortic interactions to discover and nice some of the way we can do them to discover and nice some of the way
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that is playing by changing changing and other sheequivalent and other sheequivalent to play a couple of the crowd.
This interactive portraits of the interactive portraits of consciously.
Indians next to each other, they will be interest to each other.
If they get surround, they can be surround.
And they feel movement and catching them movement.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of everyday is the use of all the way from a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of the interesting of the interesting of fluid that is a fluid consequenced of this inter
In this example in this example Sifttables and I can use them to go color in a very embrace color in a very empty in a very empty of the powerful of gone.
If we have threw over the last of a little back.
There are some of the shore of education, for education, mathematics and logics and logics that we want to give people opports, and logics that we want to give us the opportunity to see things quickly immediately.
Here is showing -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci through a simple account programative programative.
Here we show a game that a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single shapes on every Siftable, and shaped words are controlled in a dictionaries are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it is very rescue, and apparents a new series of letters with behind a new series of opportunities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I asked them to make it and make a video of them and make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Most word and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people test the testing.
That's our earest bombs the right botom, right?
And it turns out he wanted to go out the Siftables left to the Sifttables
For him were just blocks.
Here is a interactive painting a interactive painting
We wanted to learn a platform for the language of language
This is Felix that demo.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the table with the Siftable with that character of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table.
Here he leaves the sun operate.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good god! Yeah! Yeah!
By the shake of Siftables and the next to each other, he can respond to each other, and to make the cardacts with each other -- Video: Wak the neighborh!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decide how it goes up.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example I will show you today to show Is a synthesizer and music tools and music strument that we developed recent a sound produces a sound produces like the lead, bass and drum.
Eender has four different variations, where you can chose what you want.
These sounds can be injected in the living in the way that you can determine the patterns that you can determine.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way, from a very very very Siftant. There are live controllaboratible as reverb and filter.
They are being able to a sound and attacked by the office office with the office and assons.
And every general effects like tempo and volume that are taking at the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We start with a liad in two Sifttables, to a liad to a first pattern, a first pattern, a lead.
Now I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now I feel about a bate.
Video: And now I copy the filter on the drums, so I can affect the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect of the effect live the effect of the press,
Video: DM: I can accelerating it by the cancer of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I copy the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can reremain the pattern as it play.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything else and shorter as I want to do it.
With the dimmaking the dims of the volume Siftable to the left of the volume Siftile on the left of the volume Siftil.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion goes to make new people to make new people interfaces that are better interfaces that are better dested in the way our brain and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of element in this design area that we develop in the lab that we develop in the lab that we develop in the lab in the lab in the lab in the lab of the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the attention to a very new generation to a very new generation of helping to the interact with digital media that bring the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at a look at a lot of them to talk to you.
I'm writing.
But, writing is my work, but so much more than that.
My whole life for for a long time, I have writing writing that will change.
And yet, there is something that happened in my life and career, in my life and career, which I had to re-relationship with my work with my work with my work to re-in-front of the work with my work again.
It started with a book that I was wrote uncome along a memoire: "Ets, Bids, Beminne, which is in opposed to my early work all over the world and an international exister of entirely existered to my first one of the world and an international existered with a book of the world and a international engineering
The consequence is that people now have to go everywhere, and always teged me as if I did do a little bit of the way that I do.
And the thing -- -- gets do!
People come to me and ask me and ask to ask me that you will never be a success that success, you will never equal?
Don't you get your whole life will continue your whole life but never write a book will published a book will walk warm.
Don't you get there?"
Very reposed to you.
Of course, that would be very very of, but I remember about 20 years ago, I remember about 20 years ago, when I told a teenager -- if I told writer.
People said, "Don't you get success, you will never get succes?
Don't you get to do you in this way, that you will have to be suppos?
You don't you get your life to work in your life to this work without any that there is ever something from your mouth and that you'll die on the puin of your broken dreams with your mouth with your mouth of fail?"
Something in that streting.
And in the short comes to ask on this questions to this is "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all these things that are called called "Sce:
All of the time
But I'm also a lot of other things afraid for a lot of other things afraid for a lot of other things.
For seawe, and other engineer, and other engineering things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time to the last time that comes from.
Is it rationel?
Is it logical that somebody is afraid to be afraid to the work for which they have seen to their mental on Earth are se?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the minesses of the minesses of the mindslightly doesn't happen at all.
Take my father. He was chemistrace, and I can't remind me that there was a little bit of a 40 years he was asked somebody to him if he was asked somebody to him if he was not frightened to him if he was not frightened anybody to do anybody in the 40 years he was
And that's what "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry?"
No, it wasn't talking about it.
To fair is chemist: chemists have been separated by the centuries have been not a reputation of manically, for a lot of manically, for a lot of manically, to be manically,
You know, you repulling these kind of reputation.
Not only writer, other creative people have apparently instable, the reputation mental instable.
And look at the grimming death the most magnife creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own stified by own stify in their own stified by own stired.
And even those who don't have a suicide vocicide of their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be suicide to be
In the last interview for his death Norman Mailer: "You know, each one of my books is a little of minds."
That's a lot of what to say about your life work.
But from these kind of outside of this kind of exciting of this kind of exciting
We all have heard it all earlier and have accepted it to my all accepted.
The brain is that creativity is that creativity is unlocked to suffering with suffering and that a powerful eventually artist-existed to lead to misere.
So that's why everyone here today I want to ask everyone here today to life?
Do you do that OK?
Because I'm thinking about it, I think it's all a good thought.
I think of the resident of the resistance.
And even more dangerous.
I wouldn't like this this century, I would be so forth.
We can be able to creative spores a lot better to live.
I'm sure that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in dangerous to live.
Sore the phase that my career,
Go took only young, a high-young, a high-young, a high.
I can spend four decades.
Hharvest everything that is probably what I'm still going to be still in the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside, as the work that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can clap you can sells you is my biggest success for the most success of the most success of me.
Jemig, what an idea!
If you think about this is what you're going to know about nine in the morning to the front of the further in the morning to the front of the morning to the front of the morning to the fur.
So I don't want to want to be not.
I love to me about the work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think of the conclusion that I can only go through writing if I can just go through a psychological protection in the process of the process of in the process in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of in the process of the process of a psychological protection of the process of the proc
I have to write a security to create a setty, and my belief very understand fear of the reactions on my future published to the reactions on my future publications.
I've been looking for the last year, for a way to do that.
I do a history and I do do a lot of history, in other civilizations to see or others to see whether others have found a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search for me has been brought to me at the old Greeks and Rombs.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Rombs and Rombuls people didn't have that creativity was from herself.
And they believed that creativity has a divity a divity of a dished place to the human beings was a little fage of reasonable reasons.
The Greeks called this calls called this calls of creativity "demonents."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that words him words to refluist.
The Rombs had a species of the Romb.
And if you had this was a guy creative mindset of a genius called "genious genior.
The funny is that the Romomeinand a genius with a genius to be a particular pient.
In their polar entition was a kind of magical divent entition that was helped in the walls of the ateler of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house in the house
If the artist's work, the genius assistance.
Some he gave form to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be in his work
The artists was so in protection to be in protection to a lot of narcism.
If you was brilliant work was brilliant to be all the honor for it.
Everybody knew that a unseen unable genius you had helped it.
Wd your work was crowd, then that not only you load to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genius genius
Long time is that in the West in the West creativity was considered to be considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed was changed
And there is a new idea: the individual human is the resource of the universe and allow all the gods of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attention from the Godly world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity of the individual from the individual came out of the individual.
And for the first time in history there was a lot of artists that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius had a genius and they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius didn't have a genius and
I have to say that I find a big froped to say that a big freeze.
To one person, one single individual individual to believe that he or she is the crucial mystery, the source of the century mystery, of everything that is creative and the known before -- that's -- that's too much more responsible to a fragile for a fragic human psyche.
It's like you to somebody asks the sun in swallows the sun in swhether you know.
Egos are relow-up to gigantic proportionable high expectations to performances to performanced to performanced to performance.
And I think this pressure, the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists of artists
And if that is so I think is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we get back to a parent to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relation?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years to make rational rational home, in a 18 minutes to do about 18 minutes for a 18 minutes for a 18 minutes to do rational speech.
Probably in the audience of the audience that have recently recently about the idea that elphysical creatures with some of the fact poeder the work of poorest to inspiring the work of artists.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you in there.
And yet, I'm going to ask it out.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we have that thought not to do that though?
It just squeeds as much awful as all the other explanations of totally calculate the totally calculate process,
And everybody who have to create something to create something -- so in fact, in fact, in fact, that the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to create something rationally rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to create rational process --
And that sometimes the paranoral.
I have a great American closer to the great American closer Ruth Stone of the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great.
She's thick in the nine; Her whole life already writing them.
She told me about her childdhood on Virginia.
Some times she was on the field of the work was felt to the work, felt them on the country.
It was so saying that there was a big wave, as if there was a big wave,
And so a poem of golfing over the country to her --
She felt that the soils started to sit and she knew that her at that points her at that points her life: renes for her life.
She ran home, back to home in the poem and she had to do quickly as quickly and paper.
When the poem was that poem by her hundred was that her only chance to write it up.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then and rough, but it doesn't reach, it doesn't reach.
And at such a moments the poem by her himself -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in a different poet.
And then, there were a little -- this is the most beautiful part of the story -- that they were close to almost a mist.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper the paper and she's paper to her her him.
Just at that potle-had a potle-ft.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plucked the poem of the sky.
She paked the close to his tail, and it back into her body, and it back into her body, while she wrote the back of her body,
And in that cases came up with the poem of well-well-became very paper in the case of paper,
When I think -- I thought -- what is accident, what is accident, my creative process!
So my creative process, I don't have a medium!
I'm a mouth, which is a micle, every day on the same time and sweeping with blood, sweeping and trans through it.
But even in that day. I had to have a sense of a such of experience.
You will also know it to know that sense that sense that there are creative ideas in your stories from a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that for resource?
How can we use it without that we use it without a little bit?
So a way that is good for us is?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is a musician Tom Waits.
A couple of years ago, I was interviewed it for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is a lot of his life is a lot of the toon-image part of the crazy artists that from all power grip to get to get to the uncontrol of the uncontrols in him of undisplay in him of the major creative impulses in him.
With the years was Tom a little bit more quoterer.
And one day he saw in Los Angeles over the froad, and changed the process of radical --
And as he got so he heard a fragment, he heard a clip of a melode.
The decided to him, as inspiration that do is degraph, intable, cwellent.
It was a nice melosays, and he wanted to further it was going to further and he wanted to further it.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper tout, no paper ecorder to the task.
The well-known span nam of him: "I set the melodies that shape, and then it stays to me backwards.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get a little bit of panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new new ws.
He looked up, he looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat the sense of the stuff --
"Do you think I can write a song, you know, I can write a song,
If you really want this song, you have to assume to be later, you have to add if I have time for you.
You don't know, anyone else in a little fall.
Go buhour, at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment lose the process of very different.
The work itself, the work is the same thing, with the except of the board.
But the heavy that was disappeared the creative process in him when he distance of geniius.
The genius was going to be on the skin, and then the only and I was saying it.
And then realized that there was no reason to go on the bottom to go on the bottom with it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the owner of Tom and the owner aspect that not completely of Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of working on the work.
I've had been a profict of it.
I was in the middle of the writing process of Bidden, Beminning.
And at a point of view in despad.
You know that you want to do work and you think it's not going to be a terrible disaster is going to be a terrible disastinguce.
Not just bad bad -- really horrible bad it.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that was remember, and I decided to way.
I wonder from my huscrips and directly to me to a very very angal corner of the room.
And I said, "Look, "Listen then, we know all of that if this book is not just to be brilliant by me.
You can see that I have in the way I have in what I have in my thing.
I don't want to give you a minute.
If you find that it better can, you have to get your thing to do.
You know, you don't do that? Do you don't thank you.
I just writing because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notull is a little bit of a lot of cantor that is just a difference on office on the office of cant."
Tja--- U.inventually it comes up to this ...
Euwest in the North African desert African desert people together to dance in monthlide to malight to malight on sacred music.
Ors and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, it happened to be something extraordinary --
One of those dancers then transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen something like a little thing in a performer.
It was like the time was stood and the dance of a purt.
He did nothing different, but nothing else than the thousands of nights together.
And suddenly he wasn't just a human beings a human beings a human beings.
In him, under him above him above it.
A godddly furing him.
And if something happened to be something like thing, who was Dan people what it was began to clap and clap in the choice: "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because it was for them.
And by the way, a fun historic fact, when Moren Spaint, when Moren Spaint, they brought this living with them.
The quote is echer by the centuries and hate from "Allahh" in "Allah."
That hear you hear today in fighting and flaments and flaments and flaments.
If an artists in Spain something impossible, or magical does, "Allah, oil, oh, great, OK, all of them, bring."
See, it is a slip of God.
And recipe what we need.
Lasty is that the dancer that the next morning to the next morning, that he discovered on dinsday to be 11 o'couldn't be a godleal charge of a divine charge of the morning.
And at that point, he's another one of older man with bad of bad with the such of the heights of the heights of the heights.
Maybe there will never be someone more of us to have a little bit of thing,
What should he now is to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really hard to sell a creative minds.
But it doesn't have to be not to be to.
Imagine that you don't go from your person to come to your person aspects of your person from yourself.
If you believe that you believe them to be a while, you have a while to be a little source.
When you are ready with a person on someone else.
And that's what it is considered everything.
I hit in the average of minds.
The last months I've worked on a book that will be short. The book will ship. The book where a lot to be reflecting to be reporting to be reported to a book for a book to be reported to a book to a book for a book to be different.
The soluger of the illustrength advance;
And when my thoughts with me go on the goal -- I think of the same on: I think of the same one: don't don't reach it.
Do just your work.
And if you do thing -- you know, whatever it is.
If you join your job is to dance your job.
If the dival genius is decide to have a little bit of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source, then "Oly!"
And it doesn't go to that not, then, then, then,
And also "Oly!"
I believe that of hard.
"Oh, no!" "Well, anyway, because we have a pure human love and actual human love and actual equality of plumbers.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I've been talking about a couple of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and discover from genes.
We actually started from a new point: we were the biology to the digital of digital code to a new phase of digital code to a new phase in the biology with the design and synthesize and synthesize of life.
So we have always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think have tried to understand the way to understand in different levels have tried to understand in different levels,
We tried different approach, it brings back to minimal minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to digitize 20 years of digitizing today.
When we have sequence to the human genome genome of the biology, to the analoge world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask alive, can we regenerate life or can we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can refrigined itself in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can come to a nature smaller genome can come to a nature smaller.
We can go in the order of hundred genes out of the order of the 500 or something,
But if we look at metabolic map, is that relatively relatively compared to the inside.
Gelood me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch, it's very unlikely that this would be very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell of the genes that would be able to switching a living cell of the genes that would be able to switch a living cell genes that would be a living cell cell cell genes
And we decided to ask the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundaments so we could make the components to make the components to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like this: "Can we have a chromosome of the chromosome of the syntheses?"
Stage the chemistry, to make these very large molecules that we have never seen before?
And, if we do that, can be a chromosome of """Hees"
A chromosome of the way, by the way, by the way, a little chemical ints of chemical material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of digitize of life is accelerated on exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code rather slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly sloslowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slosed to write a little slose
And our last point it would be put on a point on a little exponential curve.
We're started to get over 15 years ago.
There were some staged to be a couple of stage bio-ethical stock eventually the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be a very hard to be very hard.
There are 10 thousands of thousands of DNA little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make it pieces of the longer you make a little bit more false.
So we had to make a new method for the condition of these little pieces and correct the correct of all the errors of all the errors of the errors of all the errors of the errors of the errors of the errors of the errors of the little bits of the little bits of the little breets of
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria little virus that bacteria little virus that bacteria.
We designed the couple of years, the front of the foutcorrection
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of a chemical chemical stygen in the bacteria and the bacteria genetic code, and viral particles and virtually making the genetic code,
The vial particles were going to losing the virtually they came back and killed the E. coli.
I was a speak with the oil industry, and I said she was that model but all too well.
They laugh more than you laught for more than you to laugh.
So we think this is a situation where the software can build a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And that's why we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes that we could vary the cassettes variety of the cassettes --
to go to understand what the realm is the invites of a living cell cell.
The design is critical information is critical information in the computer than that must be digital information to be very accuraate.
When we first assumped this genome to 1995 was the standard of the fairly in 1995 a 10,000 basepares.
And finally we found after resequencing 30 mists. If we had used the original sequence than it was not able to start.
Mority of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to overlapping with all other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller sub-unitting smaller sub-unitting that we have to design so they can design so together.
We design unique parts in the world.
Maybe you have read that we put water marks.
Being this four-lettery called a four-genetic code: A, Gand T.
Trios of those cos code for roughly 20 aminosils -- that there's a one one of the aminoxygen of every aminoxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write, though.
And at the and, we have only more signments --
Some of them were felt that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces of these pieces of single that we can eat them with enzymes.
There are enzymes that they repairing and together.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces that were five to 7,000 letters long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters long, only taken from 24,000 letters to 7,000 letters take from that to 72,000.
In every stage in every single stage of these pieces so we could sequence because we could create a process because we want to create a process that very robust -- that will show you a little bit of you see straight -- that will you see a little bit of a divery.
We try to achieve the point of automatization of automatisfactor.
So this looks like a basketbalfinal finale.
Once we come to the real big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares, they don't grow that easily more in E.
That turns the most of the modern crowd of the modern cular biology.
And that's why we went to be to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-o-o-co-in-centive called by the biology to repairs, that can feel bunch of casures together.
Here's an example of it.
There's a organism called Deinocococcus radiodurants that three million radiodurants that three million radiation to can.
And that you see that in the top panel, set me sopm sopm sopm just satch out of each other.
12 ot 24-hours later, he put it back together, and it was first time to be in each other,
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drought up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can find life in space, that can find for, a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of the way, out of the outside.
Here's a microph of the molecule that we made with these processes with these processes -- actually only yestern mechanisms with just yester-making microping the right design of the pieces that we did in them.
Gist cared to make it car to bring automatically
This is not an electron-microscope microscope photograph.
It's such a molecule that we can see it with a light microscope
These are photographs, genomes are taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the published that we spent recently brought to be alongs.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule is over 300 million.
If we would pressure, if we would take a 10-point of gaps to do a 142 pages to pressuppling the genetic code down.
All right, how do we started a chromosome chromosome of the activate it?
And with a virus is clearly easily.
And with a bacteria is a much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give your eukaryots, like us, you know, you just weep, you know, you know the cell and does another in, and that's what you know when you are reading.
In the bacteria species of the chromosome of the cell, but we have seen a full transplanted to the entire transplantation of a chromosome transplantation of a cell to another another, and can activate it to another another, and can activate it to another one.
We have a chromosome of the micromosome microbs of a micro-bitchromosome micromosome microbs.
These are about as far as people and mics.
We put some extra gene of extra to select this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the ones of the extra gene of the extra genes of the extra genes to take this chromosome of this chromosome of the extra to select for this chromosome of the extra little bit of extra chromosome of extra little bit of this chromosome of the extra chromosome.
We have a single to make all the protein to make all the protein to make a little bit of the protection.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be able to value the very advanced graphics here -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to soil, but we tried to develop the process of what further out of the process of what further --
This is an essential evolutionary evolution mechanism.
We discover all sorts of species that have taken a second chromosome thousands of character or a thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People who are evolution to precious as if there is one changed to have a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes that are actually called DNA that really make DNA
The chromosome of the cell was not haven't eat.
The cell -- the chromosome of the cell we put in it -- well.
It was expression, and it recognize the other chromosome strange of material, and so we finally had the cell with the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome strange of material, and it was a strange of the new chromosome strange of chromosome of the new chro
He was blue because he was stopped to the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in very short time in very short time all the characteristics of one species and changed in the new species of software that we in the new software that we put in the cell.
All protects changed, the membranes changed the genetic code, it was changed in which it changed was changed in the way it was changed in the way that it was changed the exactly changed the membranes changed the genetic code, was the exactly where it changed the membranes changed the membrans, the exactly where it was changed the exactly where it changed the exactly where it was changed the exactly chan
This is a power as a genomic, but we are in the state of the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change fundamentally changes.
All I paid for earlier to this is not a creation -- this is a front boards at 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of new species of scale design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's quite clearly clearly if you look at what is needed is.
We're going to be soon, and a half to nine billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet
for each one of us who lived in 1946; within 46, that will be four or there will be four there.
We have trouble with food and a half billion of clean water, medicine, drugs, fuels for the six-and-half billion.
And that's difficult to do that for nine to do that for nine to do that for nine
We use five billion ton collaps, more than 30 billion ves:
That's 100 miloons of fellow fellow and this is a day.
When we take biological processes of biological processes or whether process than any process than to replace that a huge challenge of challenge.
And then of course, then there is all these carbon dioxide of the atmosphere is going to be in the atmosphere.
And by the way, we have been to have a database with about 20 million genes, and that would I'd like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of diversity that is coming from there.
We are precisely constrained by a biological reality and our imageation.
We've got techniques thanks to do something called synthesesemethods to do "combination genomics."
We have the potential to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day a day a day of a day to make a million chromosomes a day to build a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day to build a million chromosomes can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the processes of 20 million different genes or tries to optimalizing processes to make octon or medicine, or medicine, or medicine, we can change with a little team, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's only standard standard selection.
We can select select for life fatbulability, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen main image of what real designs is that we work to work on the gang and a new kind of thing and a new kind of computer.
We don't know person how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of how their genetic code of what their genetic code of what their genetic code of what their genetic code of exactly how their genetic code of exactly how their genetic code from the genetic code of their genetic code of the genetic code of their genetic code of what their genetic code of exactly the exactly of how their genetic code
We focus now on four generation fuels.
Realthanol to ethanol ethanol experiment.
We have second generation fuels that will come to out of the sugar, to more higher as sugar to more higher fuels like octan oils or different tututuanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food price to make the food price and conversation is to relay as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we are cells to design that we are cells to design that can do it in that way, and we think we think we have the first fourth generation burns within about 18 months in about 18 months of 18 months and in about 18 months of ances in about 18 months and to be a or of the anks to be able to be the aness.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries -- but by our worldwide, we have other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles depth, with cooking heart temperature temperature temperature --
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy sources as energy source.
We're looking at whether we can take CO2 -- which can be moved through the crows, which can be shaped to factories, where that CO2 to fire, where that CO2 to send this process.
So in a short time we think we're able to think we're able to expanding to the basal question, "What is alive to the basal question, "What is alive to life?"
We have real, you know -- you know, the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED -- what do is what you do?
A important energy source of energy source of energy.
But we also work on the case of these tools to think about quick servaccines to think about quotes.
This year there was the flu -- we always walk a little behind the facts of the facts to the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by the text, to make combined vaccines.
And here is what the future can see is going to see because the evolutionary tree, the evolution tree, evolution tree, evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're still ahead to improve people.
Our goal is to assume that we make a chance to survive for a long enough to survive to do that well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as to show you is a fundament of a new technology that we bring to a new technology that we were in a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a surrounding that you locally or at distance with immense amounts of data.
We look at the time, we look at digital images and can be able to stay in the digital images and can bring the bulls and the sorts of gardens and the sorts to our wish and the sorts of our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera pictures, but this is a scan from the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel
It all doesn't matter because it makes the only thing that would affect to affect the amount of pixeless is the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a fully book, an example of the data.
This is the graue house by Dickens. Each coluce:
To prove that it is really text, and not to do something something like this, we can do something something to do something to show that this really is text; this is not a image.
Maybe this is a strange way to read a little bit strange way to read a honor.
I wouldn't be it.
This is a realistic example of this is a quote of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a subject of a subject.
This is really a fun, you really the pleasure and the experience of a real papers or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have done something with the corner of this exciting of The Guardian
We made a nice of advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information --
If you want to see the potential of this car here, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen through the screen through the screen through the screen.
We hope that this is not going to be more pop-ups and other such flawwwell, so.
Of course, a maps of course, for the hand is applicating a technology like these, I won't spent time to spend here to spend up to this fields that we can contribute even much more contributions.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top of the NASA image of NASA
Let's look at something different.
This is now living live on the Web; you can see it.
This project called Photosynth, which connects two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very nice computer vision by Noah Snavely, provening the University of Washington, by Steve Seitz on University by Steve Seitz on U.W.
and Rick Ssleep, at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's front of Seadragon.
When we do this, you see that we can experience the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution to experience.
The spatial disheer of the images is here meaning is the sense of the images.
The computer vision algorithms have brought these images together to the real space -- that they refer with the real space of the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genome. And so you see elements of stabilized diashostabilized diasows or images, and all these things are spaced room.
I don't know sure or there is another environments.
There are more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more television.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototyping of Photosynthesize that we work about this summer, what I have in my head is the realization of this technique, at the power of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to read the lawyers and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with with images from Flickr. You just look for a little Notre Dame on in Flickr, and you get images of people in a shirts, and the campus and thirts, and campus and campus and campus and the campus and the campus and thirts, and you get you images from people in Flickr. You know, you get a reconstruction of the Notre Dade in Flicr. You just get a shirts, and you know, you know, you get you can get a little bit Notrick to do a little
And each one of these orange chain, which is a image that was part of this model was a image of this model was going to be part of this model of the orange of this orange that was a image that was a image that was part of this orange that was part of this orange that was part of this orange that was part of this orange that was part of this orange that was part of this orange that was a image image that was a image of the oranchickingle one of these oranchicks.
And so all these Flickr images, which are all these images, which are spent to be copied a lot of crazy.
And we can do a simple way we can do a simple way navigate navigate
You know, I had never thought that I would have never worked at Microsoft
It's overwhelming here is to be defined to be to be to be to be overwhelming here.
I believe you can see that this is many tyes of cameras -- everything from glad to mirrors a lot of them together, a big number of them together, a big number of them in this environment.
I'm going to try to find some strange images.
There are so many works with the faces and things like though to be like this:
And somewhere between nowhere between a series of pictures -- here they are one.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also choiced by the program.
If we have a physical image in diver, in a physical imavirtually of this environment.
What we want to say about this is that we can do things with the social environment. This is using the data of everyone -- from the whole collective memory of how to do is what to do is what to each other.
All these photographs are moving together, and forms a very little bigger than the sum of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of Earth is coming from the entire Earth
So this as a sequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that growing in complexity when they use it to use the advantages of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are going to be able to see from metape data that somebody else invoted to somebody else in the way.
If someone would want to climit would like to climbed their names and their names is going to be able to the Notre Dame is require that that I can use as a access to the space, that metap-versus of crossed photographs, and created a kind of cross-modale, and created a kind of cross model, and created with this kind of cross-model, and created a kind of cross-modalready modle and they can do with a kind of like a kind of crosaccross modle modle of
And of course, is the by-product virtually rich virtually from any interesting place on Earth, who only from Earth, who only from sky photographs, satelling images, satelling images, but also from the collective images.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what makes you copy software possible, in the next years, all the images that can be did, all the images that can copy copy?
BA: Yeah. What this really is discovering this is discovering
It creates the wish: hyperlinks between images.
And it does that based on the data in the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the wealth when you think about the wealth of semantic information that many of these images.
When you look at the web for images, you can do a search in a search of invent, and the text on the webpage of information about what the image images.
What if now is that coped images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes from that previously comes out of that comes out of the cassic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense places and eat the powers of events and eat life between those who have to live between those who have not forget to live in the wind, who feel that have not forget to feel in the wind, the post-polished in the wind, profited in the protecting plants.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still travel still travel of the galaxy, or that the myths of Inextended to have meaning in the Himalaya boodhand still to make your breathing to do is still remember of Dhars you remember of Dharing you really remember of the anthropology, the world that we live in a absolutely of the anthropology is not just one more sangously, but is not only one more absolutely single of the reality:
the consequence of a set set of apping choices that created our ancestors generations ago.
Of course, we all parts are the same display requishes -- while children in the world. Brenes children in the world.
We all make inforced in the way we do it.
And so, with the including distinction by the box.
So it cannot be surprising that we all all of them, and dancing art.
But interesting is the unique cadans of the song and the ritm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is about the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the Voo-Coliets in Haiti, or the U.K., or the Curn desert in North Kenya, the Curn Kenya, the Candero in the Sahara. The Cander's Aai Kenyaian -- this is the man with whom I reised with a maago, or a maago.
Everest, the godding mother of the world.
They are all that we can think of us all that we can think of different, different, in orients.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of it.
Samen forms the intelliligent cultures in a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and to her as the biological life is as important as the biological life web, the biospiritual life.
This cultural life web you can imagine you imagine as a etnospher
The etnote parenty, you can define if the totally the totally of all the thoughts of all thoughts, myths, ideas, inspirations and intuitions that are front of human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness since the beginning of our consciousness.
The etnonosed is the big nalature of humanity.
She's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as amazing curiosity of animal species.
Just as the biosphere is a fast parenty, is the etnosed that equivalent that too, and even in much larger mate.
No biologist, no one would be able to work that at least half of all species on the point of extinct in the point of extinct.
And the most optimistic scenarian scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenarian scenarian for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is losing to languages.
When everyone was born to the fact there were born to get six-thousand tales on Earth were talking about the Earth --
A language is more than her word-scat or her grammatical rules
A language is a disheer of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that is reaching the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Each language is a century ancient old -- a crowd, a thought, a number of mind, an ecosystem to spiritual powerful of opportunity.
And from that six-thousand langues today is a half of the day in children's ores.
They are not longer to be a longer to be babies longer to be a longer for the longer to be longer in the longer as a longer one.
Effective means that unless of a change that unless of a change that they are already dead.
Is there something a little bit more like to be by the stilt, the last of your people, the last of your engineering your language to have no chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors of the kids?

It's a picture I was a picture that I was ye.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive willing from the repertoire of the shaman.

And it turns out to all the 17 species in a night in a night to have a lot of these tunes in different towards of sings.

Where you look at the world, you will notice that it's not the fate of these cultures to disappearing these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living folloes, which is being being by identified by identified their apply capabilities.
Or now this is about the huge missing in the home land of the Penan, a nomadic sease that until and with the last generation of in the forest generation in the forest generation of the forest and now reduced to service service to service service of the reversed to the river, where you can see that the river, and prostitutes that the rivers of Borneo to Sout.

Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of studie, you see the wrace of political government.
Genocide, the physical excise of a popular are, universally rejudge of the life of the life of a people, is not only being being being being being being in many areas don't even divided in many areas as as as as as as a part of a developing strategy.
The pain from Tibet is not to contain the basic level, until you get to the basic level in the present.
I have a young colleague in West-China to the land from Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
It was when I came to Lhasa -- I understood the face behind the statistics that you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroying at the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was acknown to the Panchen Lama.
And on that he was on the right thing that was killed in the Chinese invasion of that was starting to be killed.
His flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people in Nepal Bow's so.
His mother was prison because she was rich because she was rich

And one day she got to a poorest a doctor, on a poorest this over, set this overover, they were shaped seven years to detect seven years from way.
The pain from Tibet can be unreportioned to be free to the follow is something to fast your close to be flake.
And finally it comes up to a choice.
Would we live in a gray world of a gray world or want to be we live a color of diversity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead saying that she was peace that we direction, amor, amor, amor, amor, amor, image image that we are moving into the right image of the same anthropology told that we directioned a little anthropology that we are acropull of anthropologist,
We would not only be the human imagination of human imagination to a small, modal thinking, but we would have been dewaken and forgotten that there are other options of exist.
We can feel us to feel in the idea that our kind of only 150,000] years,
The Neolitic Revolution, which we got agriculture where we gave us to the cult of the seed when the power of the shaman was replace by the proshaman by the proshaman by the priests and we shot a specialization by specialization and we had a degree about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
This surface history is going to be the idea that we have all the answers to all the question of all the question that we will come to our path.
If the intelligives of the world to be asked the meaning of people, they have to responsed with 10,000 different voices of voices.
And it's in that song that we will discover the potential to be what we are going to be a conscious species that allow everything to make all the people, and all the garden to make all the people, and make all the garden of optimism.
This picture I have a picture in the northern point of Baffin Island taken up with Inuits on narwal to be singing narwai.
This guy, Man's Man's Man's told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextor of the 1950 was in the 1950 to save our sous, in the 1950 to save our sover.
The opa of Olayer to go to go.
The family for his life and unnage for his life and unnam already him already for his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inuit not afraid for the col; they made use of the col; they used to use it.
The gify of their key original cause of their fish in caribooks.
Olayer was not frightened for the polar night or the storm that was running the storm that was running to the storm that was running for the polar night or the storm that was running for the polar naight or the storm that was saying the polar night or the storm that was reaching the storm that was running to the storm that was not frightening.
He went outside, he left his bounces and poet, he would push powful and poet, when the poep began to freezing, form he shaped it as a limmet.
He brought a low-to-day speekings on the side of the wheeling of the wrong
When it was solid, he was slaught with it.
He unfeled the dog and improvised a harnahy.
Of the ribban he did a bad one.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood and disappearing about the ice foot pooms.
And it doesn't have a lot of stuff, in many ways, in many ways, in many ways, a lot of operating the Inin and all the inhead all the inheaded in the world.
In apse, 1999 was the Canadian government the Inin the full of the Inin the full of country greater than California and Texas saming us and Texas a new home.
It's independent. They remember all the soils of the founds.
It's a regular example of how a nation can be a nation enough to do.
And finally, I think it's clear, I think it's clear, at least for who is to get to these hurt from the world is required, that they actually don't get away to go away.
They're somebody's home country.
They are about twices from human imagination, which are going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, as the unsoil, the dreams of the unbounded of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely the idea that politicians never reaching anything else.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic not convinced but we believe that stories can change the world, that we probably the best storytellers in the world that we probably the best storytellers in 156 million times a month, 35 million times a monthropulls on TV and our magazining a million-public.
We make a fell to travel to the fattlester and we can find a way to be able to live in such particular cultural places, where the toeschant to be so idistly identify away to be able to live in a variety of anthropology will deserve to life that this world is going to be able to life in a multiculultipluralistic and pluralistic and pluralistic world and pluralistene.
where all the people can contribute to our mindshes to us well well well as us well well as we have been saying well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have pointed to a book on which I have powered to talk to you a book of a book of the question.
Maybe you see paralls you see paralls of other sources.
I am also trying to assume to explain some connect that you might have been crowd.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official of all Westery, industrialized societies.
And that official dogma is sacks, like this: To get the well-making our citizens, to get to get so much of our citizens, we have to give them as much individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good good at part of the human beings of human beings of human beings
And the freedom of freedom to do to treat a poinsed to a higher welfar without insances without insances of thirds.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically means more well-freedomatic well.
This is so deep getting in our society that nobody would be dout.
And in our life is this dead is this dead of defense is that a little bit of a cup.
I'm going to give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
And at the time, that there are 175 can-scene engineering in my supermarkets of a lot of extra-virgin oil and twell of a lot of balalances have been across a lot of balances of the superstios of these 175 canos of the supermarplenable.
And you can make a tiny of the past of these 175 species for the case between 175 species for you,
So that's the attone of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can asset your stereoset -- loud of them -- loud of cassettesple -- cassettesple and cassettesple of the things like this.
At one electronicastore. You can chose from this number.
You can be a million different systems, together with the parts of these store.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young, you could have all sorts of phone services, but at Ma Bell.
You home the devicals. You bought it.
That was the way the advantage that the device.
And that time is fored.
Today there are a lot of different devices.
And especially in cell phones is immending the diversity.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the middle -- with the nush-making fueling bulb and creering catch a lot of the things that are lots of the things that are going to be able to do the bridge -- which is taking up with the gate --
Wellight at the store, you can't see this model in the store, but you can certainly be able to be that involved in the store.
The consequenc: people come to the store, and asking this question.
And you know how the answer to that question nois?
No, no.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do too much does.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the power of stuff, is this explosive to the power of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of life.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. inaverage is not that you go to the doctor, and that you tell tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A A or we can do B to do Bow?
A front of these and down.
B's got this front of these and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctor, what do you find in the way of think?"
And the doctor, "A preventing and B has a fail, and B has become this front and down.
What do you want to do you do?"
And you say, "Doc, if you was doing?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own inbrings of the patient."
And that sounds very positive, but in fact, in fact, that the heavy of decision, decide of someone who is definitely shift to a sick -- the doctor, someone who's seases, and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient. For on addictation to repetments -- the patient.
Good up with the battle of slaat that nowhere, because the goal-group, you and I cannot buy.
Why do do do do if we can't copy it?
Because they think that we think we go to the next morning, to ask that other market to ask that other market resources.
Our identity yet of identity is to us to be overcovered to choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is capable of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so we often want.
Every single morning to be thinking what person wants to be to you think about what person want.
Let's talk about the marriage of marriage, the family.
There's a time that freezing everybody else out of the car that you could be squickly quickly as possible, and then then as quickly as possible.
The only choice was with whom was not when and what you did you then then then you did it.
Now free everything for the operate.
I teach a particular intelligent students, which I have been set less houswork.
They don't have a single or in the early than in the early time.
No, they have a casured.
"Will I or not? Am I married to be marrie?
Or do I wait? Do I take children, or a career?"
These are all the things that are all the way to do
They go through to them to have an answer to them as this means that they don't get all their houswork, and then no good number of number of catch number of call.
And they have right. They're important life question.
And then we come to work with a Carl as a game of that technology allows us to work every minute of every day day in the world where in the world -- except in the Rolph Hotel.
There's one place, by the way, that I love secret that I love to do it.
I won't be true, because I want to keep this place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choices to work in that we are getting up to the question that we are getting up and over time, or not.
We can look at a football of our son, and we can look at our cell phone, and our Blackberrry, and our Blackberrry, and our Blackberrry, and our Blackberry,
And even if they're all from stome, we get every minute of that compete with all sorts of question, "Am I said, "Am I call this phone answer?
I’m got to this emailing task to this letter?
And even if the answer is "Nee," we experience the football of our son in a very different way.
Where we look at the big, the small, materialistic things -- life style, life styl: life is a matching lifestyle: life is a matching thing,
So the world looked like, the world was used to be there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choices of choices.
And so the world looks like.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about what is good about what is bad about it.
That enormous choicy has two effects on the human beings of a human.
A very contemporary effect is that the earlier than confusion,
And with so many choices find people have the hard to make a choice.
I'm going to give you a very dramatic example of the things in volunteer in volunteer to volunteer plans.
A colleague of me got access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a big policy society, a big policy with about a million employees about 2,000 vements.
And they found that for every 10 policies that have been adapting the worked on the worked on the worked on the shared two percent of the shared at the time.
In five ve eroxes did a lot of employees than employees than five than five soils in five so. Why?
Because it is a little bit of fiphere is so hard to choices that people just extells people to the next day, and that opens to the next day, and that on, and so forth.
And from the point of dealing from the point of decline is coming down.
That doesn't mean that means that people after their pensionation doesn't have a dress deeply to eat the point because they have been set of money for the choice as a display that they have a little bit of a partnerships.
And they had to go to a 5,000 dollars a year to their nose before they go to their nose.
The worked about the worked was to double to double their own contribute to double their own contribute
And so many choices can be paralyzed paralyzed
And I think the world is looks like that.
If it comes to the century to the right choice, you want to make the right choice, right?
You want to be not going to be resemed with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect is that the first effect is that we have, as we should, as we diswimming the paralyze, finally less tepeaces with the result of the result than the case would be if we had less optimed less optips.
And there are multiple reasons for that.
One of them is that there was a choice, for example, from a tiny dressing, that the choice.
You ask you in a case that a different choice would have been better.
This dreamed alternative is that you get to get your choice.
And so, she's soon does soil to the full of the choice, even if it was a good choice.
The more options, the more optional to have a way to have more spits of the choices of the choices of options.
A second reason has to do with substitutional cost.
Dan Gilbert gave with the way of how often we depend the value of things we do do to depend the value of things we are comparished to do it as well.
If you think of alternatives you can inthink of many alternatives you alternatives that you determines you that you would.
That makes you fewer beyond the alternative that you have chosen you've got choices.
A excuse to New Yorkers under the non-New Yorkers under you have a excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is a couple of the Hamptons.
They have a expensive one expensive --
They are a beautiful strand. Straland. Straland.
Don't be able to do it? "Don't be a convently, "It is augustus.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city.
I could do my car for the door parkers."
And he's sitting there is two weeks, with the idea that he was mislessing every day for every day parking a great parkplace.
substitutioncost of the enough of the enough of following our choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more potential to be there are more attractivity alternatives.
And those are presenting to us as a substitutional cost.
Here's another example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Life in here, and now for example, and you don't have to get away to get away from the one.
One is that you get to a point of choice other choices
And all that other has so his attractions that are involved option to the cosen option is being able to attract the crosses.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to my sarch for a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse
I walk almost always speaking.
Bet, there was only one kind of more judgment, and you bought the past, you know, the past, it doesn't get incredibly uncomfortable to be unbelievably set and often enough to waste, felt the bird of the toket town, felt it right.
And after years I went to the store, for a new now.
I said, "Day, I want to have a judge."
And the store said, "Would you get smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Would you be buying or a rhyth? Which you want to get to a runn?
Do you want to get a bree-effect?
Would you expand something like this, or flink or whether of pipal." And so he went through it.
I was talking about it was a while I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only one."
He had no idea which was a sense of what greenhouse for an hour for a hour for a hour for hour for a hours of the power.
And it was very fairly I left the store, finally I left the store of the breezing breezing greenhouse.
I could do better do it better. I could do better do it better.
But I don't felt me better.
Why? Well, for myself, I wrote this to myself, I wrote a book of a book of a book of a book of the book of themselves.
The reason I don't feel better, I think about this choicesfive was that I started expecting more to expect of a good jumped breeding a good stuff,
I started without any any expectation, because I only know one kind of spirit was a kind of speaking.
And then it turned out there are different wars, and one of those would be fast perfect.
What I was bought for a good thing, but not perfect.
And so I compared my benough with my expectations, and that powered me to count me count.
The more potential people have to be expectations to have more expectations about the deservices of that capabilities.
And that means that people are less testing with results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case you don't know what I'm talking about.
And in the real thing is going to be about both thing,
Everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was better.
Because when everything was worse to people could have even pretty surprising experiences have a lot of experiences.
In our modernity society as a well-to-being perfectioned citizens, but the best we can reach to what we have to reach is that something good as good as we expected.
Never we get touched to be surprise, because our expectations, my expectations.
The secret of happiness -- for you all of this -- the secret of happiness is not too much expectanceousinly too much expecting.
I want to have a little bit of this -- a car biographically elemented -- I was a woman who is really fantastic.
I asked her not with her less tepeaces of tepeaces --
But with less enough to take a good opportunity.
And finally, when you have a bad at the point of bad as there is only one kind of forward if you have a satisfy for why you are intesting.
The answer is that case simple --
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different greents of available to fall, you know, to have that to be responsible?
The answer to me is as simple. That's you go.
You could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different greents of slide to fail.
So if people decided to decide even though the results of those decisions are good about their choice.
And they take a whale itself.
In the Western society, clinical depression under the younger generations of younger generations of the younger generations of time.
A factor -- not the engineering factor, but a significant factor in this explosive increase of depression and suicide themselves, is that people have to have a very high expectations.
And when they try to explain the purpose itself, they give themselves, they give themselves, they give the wrong.
So the nettoresultage of the nettoresulatory, but our worse on the worse of it, but our worse
Another a summary collabor.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be refer for what is going to be reverse for what to do.
But that's not.
It doesn't suffers to choices better than not can choices better than not cannot be able to buy automatically that more choice.
There's a magical foundly on choices -- I don't know.
But I know we have been for a long time for a long time for a long time for us well-being,
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best ones we can keep the best one.
The choices of divinguished countries comes from material overfluences from material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, and we've already heard about what the problem is not that much choice, but there is that there is too much choice.
So the paradox that I talk to this is a lot of the modern, well-well-well-well-to-well.
That's frustrating, and it is a little bit of this is a little bit of you told that expensive and sunlight to installing children so. Sung of your money. Sung of your money.
I'm saying you the same about this pipelled choices -- they don't help -- they don't help to help Erger now: they focus now, they focus not, they focus not, they focus no, they focus now: they sing to help not.
They make our life less worth our lives less worth.
If a part of what people in our society in our society to make all those choices to have transmitted countries where people have to have a life to have a life of those people have forward to get out of the people on it.
And our life would be on it in the fact would go on it.
That's what economists call a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better from reversion of well-madness -- not only poor people -- and that comes from the choices that we with with our our choices that we with our our our commercial --
And finally squatter this image story -- you read this image thing, you know, "Ah, what the fish is what fish is fish there no?
None is possible in a fish."
A scrale imagination, a shorty, a shortile worldview, which was my first interpretation
But the longer I think, about it was thinking about it, I understood that this fish is a smart.
Because in fact, there is this to the hand: If you get the fish of the potential to create potential to create potential to create power, but lost light bulb paralyzing the light of the hands,
If you get the fish cross the fish to create potential to create power.
It leads to more disease, and less ratching the feature of the display to be more disease.
Everybody has a fish crazy.
This is a free to limited -- even for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the absence of a figure-fish sense of a figure, commentation, required, unit."
Thank you for your attention.
