Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the polar cap, which the polar cap, which was the past three million years of the vasted Stand, with 40 percent of the United States with 40 percent of the United States with four percent of the United States was far ar ar year as the size of the United States was a 40 year.
But this is actually the serious problem because it is not going to show the disk of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice of the ice of the North Pole is in a sense of the single heart of our global climate system.
It's in the winter and croped in the summer and crazy.
The next slide I shows is a speed-spent version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is red.
And as you see, sit out of darkerblue.
That's the annual ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in summer.
And it was so-called permanent, five years or older, is almost like blood, that is single from the body is sicpult here.
In 25 years of this is the way to this at this time.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozen around the North Icelation and there's a very large amount of frozen womer frozen carbon on dioxicrobes that it was death, microbes in methane.
And ago with the total amount of diversation in the atmosphere, that could be double that can be double that can be double when we described the point when we described the crossing point when we discribed the considered when we divel the concerned that could described that can be described the surroundary.
In some inside of the single inside Alaska sign of methane in the water.
And last winter was going to go out of Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another one team to another one deep here.
Why! It's OK. The question is the question or we will be that will be going to be that will be going to be that will be going to be that one.
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warming Greenland from the north of Greenland from the north.
This is a melectwo.
The waterle volume is bigger than oom.
This is the Kangerlussian reverse in South Witest Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea soagel because it is the landips, this is the place where it comes into the sea.
These stromings are taking on the floor.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, is the biggest ice mass on Earth.
And last month, reported scientists scientists that the continent has a negative ice a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice, in the West of the South Pole, very quickly soon of the underwateraries of underwaterary.
The whole continent is to six meters seespear ak for six meters, just like Greenland.
In Himalaya, the two after the largest ice massas, there are new now, that was now new bring a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water from that smell time.
In the Andes, is this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more straight now.
But when they disappears the drink water.
In California was a disappower of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are predictions at the time.
This global dream of drief has led to a dramatic styer of foresting forest fuels.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen several speed.
And four time in the last 30 years, in the prevent 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at the bottom from a historic context than what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours --
25 mics ton every day in our oceans, Kich well to the until area of the Stille Ocean, and from America, westone of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic number of Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dalation of the oceans.
The only big causes of warming, the earth, next to deforest, which is to deforest, is fires to 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and steench, and steench, the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest of the size of China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urban carbon centers.
But we see a circle.
These are the coal-carbon which the bital carbon which the bital years, and where green alternatives were prepared to have forgetting forward forged.
There's a political fighting the globes of the getting in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industry gave industire of coal 250 million dollars to promote "scree coal coal coal coal of coal coal of coal coal of coal coal of coal of coal of coal of coal coal of coal coal of coal coal coal of coal coal of oil industry --
And that picture was doing something something like this.
And the Christmas was at me in Tennessee, about four billion liter cools of galler stone carbon mod.
You have seen it in the news.
This is the one after one after America.
This was happening around the Kerst.
One of the advertisings, of the cooking sounded up the Kerstigate was this:
Video: "Consider is the cobbbbbbbbbbbbbbbby, a guy.
He's abundance here in America, and he care in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coat guy is scaled with the day of the day.
He's paid and estimate and employees like their jobs hold their job."
Here comes a big part of the coal coal in West Virginia food from days.
The biggest most working of the country is the big bad of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clear to be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So has the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on the too.
This is a little bit of a little bit of it.
Video "Bucy COLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our business.
That's the reason why it's the most important goal is to give a giant concern of the connect to refer and bring the light and the regular policy of the truth of stead.
Feit is, stead, not smarious.
We find that it is short -- and it even more likneat.
So, don't make worry about climate change.
Let me talk about us.
Video: Actor, Schone carbon carbon carbon carbon on it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-shoot carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are making the best is creating.
But that's the sound of creation carbon technology.
And despite the fact that the singing of steench, one of the most important causes of warming the Earth, the remarkable thing is shape of the Earth, the remarkable technology that you see her.
And look at the way this is the shone, this is the shoot carbon technology today.
Al Gore: Einventually the positive alternative alternative alternative alternational security.
Video: America wrong in crisis, the national safety of crisis, the national safety crisis.
The red rocded in all these things, is our dependence of fossile fuels, like dirty college and imported oil.
But now there's a new solution to get out of this.
And front of America 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get the America to work to work on the work of a single that makes us safer and the heat the heat of the Earth consider.
And in fact, a solution that requires that requires to solve our problems.
Repower America. On the tape of the Repower America.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Do: It's about America to give America to give America
One of the quickly ways to make a end of our dependence of old fuel of old fuels that our planet, which is helping our planet to see.
Man: Here's the future of the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Or, "Well, you know, we are paid paid to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African old African an's speaking word that says, "If you want to be all there.
If you want to go far far far with it.
We have to go far far away and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I refer back with a update about how that works.
So here I am am. For those who don't waren't waren't waren't get the biggest scientific experiment ever underneath in coms, 27 miles in circle in coms,
It has to circumstances that were attack-than a billion.
Enorm ambitius, d!
This is the machine understanding under Geneva.
We took those mini-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors and this is the ATLA. Here is the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters -- 4meters returned into diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in connect so you can see the scale.
And at 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that carry for a fetest in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle that was going to go around the LHCastraight in the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is a piece of the LHC, which was flowed by detector of the detectling of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine, which is a huge over.
I don't know whether this concept the biggest or thing, or this thing was going to Google and saw that the Internet page out of business as a saw of saw that the Internet page.
That means we made a cultural as a science of the science impact.
And one week later we had a problem with the machine, which was to make with these golden drams.
And those drambers ago, 13 thousand cut up when the machine on full force.
The engineers will say, "Not true will say, "It's not true.
They can do that because they are superago, all of the lower temperatures.
So on min 27, colder than the space between the stars, that can reach the single that radiation did.
And in one of the connectivated between the nine of the LHC, was a constructivation of the LHC, was a constructivate a constructivate a constructivated constructivation.
And it was a weird of hearmer, and it was intended to that 13 thousand covering 13 thousand calling 13 thousand of a bunch of come.
This was the result.
This is even more impression if you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of 20 tons and they were moved in about 30 inches in the time.
We civil about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did we do.
We have rescue them all rescue when they were all required.
Now they're back on a road.
Eind map the LHC will be intact.
We'll be going to get it back and we expect measures in juni or right so we can go to figure out what the building stone of the universe.
Now, of course, these are reincidently, they reincidently, the value of science research.
I think the fact that it's so hard is, the fact that we go further than anything like the LHC.
I show the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, dished I think, in the decades of the value of his learning, his his learning, his student, his learling was Michael Faratoday, this is so dangerous for progress, and then the prevent of human mind than we have science that there are not a mysterious world, and they are not completely new that are not completely new that are not completely new world, and they have no new trutruck, and discdiscoveries to discusivevey's re, we are that there are that there are that there are that there are not not not not going to discdiscdiscdiscdiscdiscdiscdiscdiscdiscovery, very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
Thank you.
I would want to start to asking you back to your childhood at your children at your childhood when you played with blocks.
And when you discovered how to grab it up and they cut up and conscious, you actually actually trouble to solve with the conscious relationship with and hanging hanging from space relationship to the consciousness of relationship to get out of space relationship with the consciously.
Rumiliant insight, because of understanding the world to understand of the world to us.
If information is inspired by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- saming with objects -- and my compass Jeed-response -- I started to ask me -- what if we were going to do -- what if we would use a computer -- what if we would use a computer that moves on on a plat a plate desquick that moves on on a plate, which we can deal with the information with objects -- --
and orders, as we can do do
And these guys that is so so that we decided to see an answer by building Sifthead.
Sort is a Siftable interactive computer in a size computer size of a cocks.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel together their movement and they contain a screen and they contain a screen and they contain contact act.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handlevel of the blocks can they get put together by it.
And the top dies are Sifttables a new example of a new ecosystem for ways of digital information.
And this is that these aid resources have a more physical differently, are conscious of their movement and even from each other, and even of the way we move to discover these new and nice interactions of interactions to discover them.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instant to tell a video to tell a video that is playing by the opportunity and others' others' coucell backward nothing is playing to the other.
These interactive portraits of interactive portraits of each other.
Indians next to each other, they will put together together to each other.
If they are surround, they can also be surrounded this and what become some nervous become some nice.
And they feel movement and hicless.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of a color as it was a fluistop.
In this example, three Sifttles, and I can use them to go color in a very very empty in a very low-to-a-to-a-to-a-to-a-to-a-to-of.
If we have threat at the time, we went back a little bit back.
There are some of the education for education for education, especially games with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give things to prove things quickly to prove things quickly immediately.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci series through a simple calculator.
Here we show you a game that is a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of a random letter on every Siftle, and caused words are controlled in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it's very rescued and differently a new series of letters with a very high computers.
Thank you.
These are some of kids on excure to the Media Lab, and I asked them to try to make it out to make a video of it.
They were actually away from them.
And one of the most interesting things of these application is that people needed instructive instructive to have instructive instructions.
And all you have to say is "Most word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people test the test thing.
That's our youngest bomba tester, righte.
And it turns out that he was living in the Siftles.
And for him was only blocks.
Here is a interactive paintingly painted
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language of language
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate
He can remember new characters in the scene, by just the Siftlowing the Siftlowing the table.
Here he leaves the sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good dan! Yeah!
And by Sifttles, and the next to each other, and the next next to each other, he can respond to each other, Video: Wak the card's death,
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a open end of an open end on the end of the way.
and he decided to deal with it.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed developed with a sound producing sound as the lead, bass and drum.
Eender has four different variation, where you can choose what you want to use which you want to use what you want to use
These sounds can be injected in the course of the sounds so you can determined the pattern itself.
And you put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the pattern of a very lost effects of display as a reverb as reverb as reverb as reverb and filter.
They are being given to a sound and adapted by the office and distincludes.
And then farther effects like tempo and volume that are taken on the pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: Did we start a living in two Siftles, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, a first pattern,
Now I put the basline of the basline of the basline
Video: Do I feel now fear of the battlework --
Video: And now I copy the movie on the press, so I can influence, so I can influence.
Video: Day I can cut it very quickly accelerating the office blocks.
Video: Desple I coping the filter on the bas for what more expression.
Video: Do I can rescue the pattern as it is playing.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything but I can improvise and shorter as I want.
And in the finally ended up the dimmaking through the volume Siftable to left the left.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion is to make new human-computer interface in the way our brain in the way our brain in the way our brain and body work and body work body and body work and body works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area that we developing in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is that this is the attention to a very new generation to a very new generation to the interacting with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at the point of all of you all the time.
I'm writing.
Booking is my work, but also writing so much more than that.
My whole life for a long life for writing and I don't think that will change.
And yet, there is something that happened in my life and career, and career, where I had to re-in-connected with my work with my work again.
It started with a book that I wrote along a book that I wrote a memoire: Beminners, Beminneration that very contrastation to my first work around and international exist.
And the consequence is that people have to do all over the way and told me as if I do do job.
And that -- gets that -- gets do!
People come to me and ask to me and questions "Don't you don't afford to do this success.
Don't you get your whole life will be writing your whole life but never have a book will be a book that people will write for warm.
Don't you get to do that?"
And at the point of the stuff --
Of course, that would be very often I remember that I remember over 20 years ago, when I was a teenage -- if I told you that I wanted to become a teenage -- if I told you that I wanted to become writing.
People said, "Don't you get success, you don't get succes?
Don't you get to afraid from it, that you will go on the levels of them going to be in the way to do?
Don't you get your life to this work is going to be not that there are something from a little bit of front of your broken on the puin of your broken with your face?"
Something in that stretation.
And in the short comes to this questions on this this is "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all these things that are called called all these things that are called called
All the time all of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things are afraid of things that all of the things for all.
And for seaws, and other engine, and other engineering things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time when those fear comes from.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that somebody is getting to work for work where they are working for their opinion, they are see?
What is so particularly about creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind-estes?
Take my dad. He was shortly, and he was scaled engineer, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years he was asked to him that he was was not afraid anybody had had not afraid to him that he was not afraid for that.
And that's how to say, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry?"
No, no, so there was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair reputation through the centuries have not been the reputation of the century reputation for piece of manical depressive alcoholists to be depressive alcoholists.
Scheat, who have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers writing, other creative people have been able to be pretty instable, instable, instable.
And look at the grimming death the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young of young, often do by own own stiers, often following in the world.
And even the ones that don't have a suicicial suicide to be under their gavents to be under their gave to.
In the last interview for his death said "My each of my books is a little bit of my books is a piece of mitrator."
That's a little bit about your life-work.
But of these kind of precise we don't look at that.
We all heard it before, and have heard it with all of the accepted.
The hemisd is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is that a artist-existing eventually indeed to missing the artist of the cally.
And so I want to ask everyone here today you can life?
Do you like that?
Because now I think about it, I think about it, I think it doesn't have a little bit about a little bit of a little dacheat.
I think it was in the reads of the response.
And also even more dangerous.
I wouldn't like this this century is that this century is so on.
We can create creative minds a lot better than to live in.
I know sure that it would be for me, in my situation, particularly dangerous to that dark thought.
Seator in which my career.
Go tunately, I'm still young year.
I can spend four decades on the center of decades.
And so, the probably will be all that I'm going to be still by the outside world as the work that following that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends in the each other, so I can do you have to do it in the biggest success, my greatest success.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think about this is you know about the morning, you know the morning, you know, in the morning to the descent.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to work with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I have come to the conclusion that I can just writing a psychological protection in the process inside the process in the process in the process in the process.
I have to write the writing a safe distance between mitself and my considered to the reactions on my future publicly --
I was looking for the last year, and I was looking for ways to do that.
I am in the history of the history and have me deping in other civilizations to see or others have found a better way to help creative people to help create with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search has been brought me to the old Green and Romend.
And let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Green and Romen's time of the old Green and believed people didn't have that creativity was from herself.
And they believed that creativity was a goddling from a didsible place to human beings came acknoknowledge to human reasons.
The Greecks of the Greecures of creativity "demonen."
And Socrate believed that he had a demon that represents him words influist.
The Romenon had a species of the same idea.
And in them was called them a genident creative mind creative spirit was a genion.
And the funny is that the Romen's not a genius with a genius to invent person inted.
In their polar polar was a genius was a kind of magical goddling in the walls of the ateler of the ateler of the artst.
And a little bit like Dobby the house --
If the artistic was working on the work was the genius assistency.
And he gave the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the afterward of the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work work.
The artists was so in protection to be taken by a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work was not going to get all the eer.
And everyone knew that was that a invisible genius had taken genius
And I was talking about you, you know, that not just set on you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genion.
Long time is that spirit is how in the West creativity was considered to the West creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
And there is a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual human is the middle and is above all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the godd-ddline world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual.
And for the first time in history was in history about artists said that they were a genius and they had not been a genion.
I have to say that I find a big front of the wrong.
And to make one person, one single individual to believe that he or she is the couple of the century of the century of all the infat, creative and creative and the known before -- that's something that is too much -- that's a lot of responsibility for fragic human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun.
Egos are really, read to gigantic proporations and there are incredible to prestative representation of prestations of prestative reference.
And I think this drug has been made a lot of artists of artists have made a lot of artists.
If that's so that, and I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a parent understanding of the relationship between human beings and creative mysterious mysterious mysterious and creative mysterious mysterious and creative mysterious mysterious understanding of the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
And we can have 500 years of rational humanism not undly to make 500 years in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speech.
And probably in the audience people who remember the scientific people who have refeled about the idea that elerate creatures with some faces that else far weather.
It doesn't seem to me get you in there.
And yet, I won't ask it.
Why isn't it?
Why would we have not a thought that are the dad of the day?
It is as much as much as well, as much as all other explanations of totally calcular calculation that are includes in the creative process.
And everyone that is trying to create something that is trying to create all the attacks, all the attacks -- you know that the creative process is not always rational required.
And that sometimes it's almost paranormal.
I have the great American closer to American closer Ruth Stone of the American closer Ruth Stone of the American closer Ruth Stone of the great American closer Ruth Stone of the American closer Ruth Stone of the American posed
And she's thick in the now. Her whole life already writing them.
She told me about her childhood on the plattempt of Virginia.
Sometimes when she was in the field of the work was felt to the work was felt to the country.
It was so said that, as though there was a big wave air came up with air of air came up with it.
And so that I diet wave than the country to her --
She felt that the ground under her feet began to shudness and knew that her at that point in the moment, and they were doing a single this: renewable,
And she ran home, back high-home, and she had to do as quickly as possible and see paper and see paper and see paper and paper than so quickly as possible.
When the closer by her hand her hand her her only was her only to writing it to write it on the way to write it in the wave of writing it in the wave was that her only to write it was her only to write it was her only to writing it was her only to write it in the poem was her only to write it was closed by her only by her only
Sometimes she was not quickly enough.
Then she roughly arrich, but calcular the house is not reaching the house
And at the point of shapes the poem by her hired in search, looking for many people, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another point -- in her words -- in her words another poet -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words --
And there were even a little bit -- this I find the most of the story -- that they have the closer to do almost miste.
And then she was looking for home and she's looking for paper and paper and shape the closed by her hids.
And at that point she had a potled.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plucked me the closer from the air.
She was taken the close to his tail and it back in her body as she was back in her body as she wrote it.
And in those cases came up with the close to what in the paper in the paper -- but in crazed shed in the end.
And when I heard that -- what is accidently, my creative process, my creative process.
This is how my creative process! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, which every day every day on the same time on the same time and big, and trans with blood, sweand trans through blood.
But even in that daily swing, I had a experience had.
You will also know the same thing you'll know that feeling creative ideas in your refrigeration from a source that you can identify impossible to identify impossible to identify as well.
What is that then brone?
How can we use it without that we get become that without a lot of the one?
And in a way that is good for us to do that?
The best contemporain contemporain this is a musicians.
A few years ago, I was interviewed it for a magazine for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life was a very part of his life was showing the shows of the crafied artists that tries to get out of all power in the unconnectively creative impulse in him.
And it was Tom was Tom some little more more quickly
And one day he was in Los Angeles on the speed by the fight-and changed the process of radical radical radical.
And as he heard about that, he heard a clip,
The deciding him, as inspiration that does does do faker does destrop, catch, crowing.
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to follow.
But it doesn't go on.
He had no paper touch, no pine, no taperecorder to the too.
The well-known excitement of him: "I reach the melodic heavy, and then it stays to me eternal backwards.
I'm not good enough, I can't be the right.
He didn't get in panic, but he was not in panic, but he stop that whole mental process, and he did something new.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat behind the stuff --
"Do you really think that I can write a songle of the one.
If you really want to get that this is come, you have to reach later when I have time for you.
Don't be anyone else else fall.
Go neighbors at Leonard Cohen." And from that point the process of course, very different.
The work is even the work itself, with the known dark on the subsider of the substance of the bottom itself,
But the heavy that the creative process in him resequence that he was distant distance of genion.
The geniiy sat the skin, and then refer and read it but not saying it.
Tom realized that there was no reason that there was no reason to go through it.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre conversation between Tom and the profoundation between Tom and the owner aspect that not completely of Tom itself.
And that story has changed.
I had been profit from it.
I was at the middle of Ets, Biddly, Beminning process.
And at a point moment I detect in despair.
You know that you don't want to work and you don't think it's a terrible disaster is that it is a terrible disappearing book.
Not just just bad a bad really horrible bad of the things that are really bad
I wanted to do all project.
And then I remember Tom that was remember that his genion, and I also decided to way.
I wonder I wonder from my manuscrips and foundly a very front of the room.
And I said hardopy, "Lister thing, we know all of that if this book is not just because it's not only because of this book is not only by me.
You can see that I have all in what I have in the way I have in me.
Mor. I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it better.
Snap you don't have that, you ammer not, youam.
I just writing because that's one time my work.
Oh, and in the notable to be distincluded that is just a lot of office."
Tja--- Usings it comes up here.
Eeuws came in the North African desert people together to catch a sunlight in maybe to dance in a sacred music.
And Uren hours and hours, until to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes happened in a very similar to the bunch of the support of the things happened.
One of those dancers was than transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen anything in a performer.
It was like the time was was the time and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights in fact, but now I think everything together.
And he was not just a human beings a human beings a human beings on the human being.
In him, under him, under him glansed it.
A goddly following him.
If you did something like something happened, knew people what it was started to clapping them and clapping them and crops, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God."
Because it was for them.
By the way that I want to reflect historic fac: When Mors South Spain Spain Spainting, they brought these usbond-awful with them.
The crazy is the craft of the centuries of "Allah" in "Allah" in "One, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, one."
And that you have today today in the day and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaunched the day.
If artist in Spain Spain something impossible or magically, is people, "Allah, oil is crawling it, all the way or own.
And it is a glip of God.
And recipe of what we need.
Lastig is that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to discovered that he was discovered on dinsdam for 11 o'd didline in the morning.
And at that point is he is a little elder man with destroyed cnees that may never come to such a little bit of the high-fight.
Maybe there will never get anybody to get anybody to do his dance.
What do is it still have to be life?
That's hard.
That's really difficult to be a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be not to be too to be not to be there.
Imagine that you don't want to get the most imusually unusual aspects of your person from you.
Imagine you believe that you have them to have a while, you know, a while return to a very specific bron.
When you are ready with it, they are given to somebody else.
And it is how it calls everything.
I hang intools that day.
The last months I worked on a book that will short soon, the book where a lot of too long as a lot of too long as a lot of response to be challenged.
The resequer of that illuster progress.
And when my thoughts with me on the goal, I like to hold me the same and, I don't know anything about it.
Do just you work.
And just you do thing, what, whatever it is.
If you're too, you know, thank you go dance to dance you,
If the goddly geniual genius to make a decision in your work at some point in your work at some point of wonderful sources, then "Olne!"
Greently, thank you all the time.
And then "Olen!"
And I believe that I believe that I believe that.
"Olen!" because we have purse human love and propertly, human love and propertly, human love and propertly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Or!
You know, I had this already talked about some of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started from a new point: we were the biology to the digital issue and now we're trying to get from that digital code in the new phase in the biology and design to design and designed to design and design synthesizing and designed it.
So we've always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think think a lot of biologists have tried to understand in different levels in different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different levels in different levels of biologists have tried to understand the whole thing that I think is a lot of biologists have tried to understand the whole thing that I think is a lot of biologists that I think is
We tried different approaches of approach to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years, it now is the digitize 20 years.
When we have sequenced the human genome of the analoge of the analoge world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask life to regenerate life or we can create new life from this digital univers?
This is the map of a small organizm, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can conceive in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at or we can come to a little bit of genome can come to a little genome of genome
We can go in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or anything that are there.
But if we look at metabolical map, is that relatively simply compared to the one.
Gell me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch to be very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell cell cell for that.
And we decided to do that the only route conditions was to synthesizing this chromosome of components to do the components to make the components to make the fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we started a chromosome chromosome chromosome of syntheses?"
Staat the chemistry to make these very large molecules that we have never seen before?
And, can we do that, if we do that, a chromosphere?
A chromospher, by the way, but a little bit of chemically, a little chemical inds material.
So, our tempo of digitize life is accelerating life is acceleration on exponential --
Our ability to write the genetic code of rather slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly of the genetic code
And our last point it would put in this moment in a exponential curve.
We're now started to get over 15 years ago.
There were some stadia for invitial stadia bio-ethic access to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult --
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA, 30 to 50 letters in lenging, so it's a degeneration process, so how longer you make the little bit of the more fals.
So we had to make a new method for conclude of these little pieces and correct correct of all the botttom.
And this was our first attempt, to start the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, the foutcorrector
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we put a little chemical chemical state in the bacteria and the bacteria genetic code of genetic code and virral particles were making gings.
The viral particles were going to be taken from the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they said that model but all too well.
They laughing more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software building its own hardware building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger
We wanted to build the complete bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic codes genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetts in cassetts in the size of cassettes --
to understand what the invent components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start start with digital information in the computer than to the computer than that has to be very accuraating.
When we first of all, this genome in 1995 was the standard of the standard precision one mistake a 10,000 based.
And finally, we found after resequencing, we were going to get the original sequence, it was not able to start starting to start starting to start on the infront of the original sequence.
And in fact, the design is design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to connect with all other pieces of 50 letters to build so smaller sub-one sub-one sub-one sub-a-one sub-of-a-such stuff that we can make together.
We design here unique parts in the world.
Maybe you read that we were able to put out in the fact that we put out in it.
Bedition, we have a four-letter-code: A, C, Go and T.
Trios of those letters cos for rubbital 20 aminozurs -- that there's a literal attack-oxy-oxxygen oxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sentences, sentence.
And in the and, we just get to me.
Some of them were televisible that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces of these pieces of syms.
There are enzymes they put together and put together.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces that were five to 7,000 letters that were five to 7,000 letters for 2,000.
And in every stage of the crows, we have a overfall of these pieces so we could create sequences because we want to create a process that is very robusted -- that you will see you get straight to see sequences that will be very robbiting to create them in each other.
We're trying to achieve the point of automatished to reach the point of automatished
So this looks like a basketbalfinal finale.
And once we get to the real pieces -- over 100,000 baseparates -- they don't grow so easily more in E.
That is the outside of all modern tools of modern tools of molecular biology.
And so we went to get to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that homolo-oil recombination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA, that pieces can fee.
Here's an example.
There's an organized named Deinoccus radio diodurans that three million radiation of radiation to can.
And you see that in the top panel, sheat at the top panel, just sheat the top panel, just set out of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he put it back in each other, exactly as it was first time.
There are thousands of organs that are.
These organisms can dry.
They can live in a vacum.
I know absolutely sure that there are life in space, that can promove forward, a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to show that there's a lot of the way.
Here's a deeply microph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually actually just yestern mechanisms with this processes with the right design.
And it is that they feel automatically add automatically
This is not an electronen-microscope microscope photograph.
It's about a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a six seconds
This is the publication that we spent ungs out of the publication that we have invented ungs.
This is over 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a humans, with a very clear structure.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point literally without spations, without spations, and then 142 pages to press the genetic code down.
Well, how do we started, how do we start a chromospher?
And it's clear a virus is clearly easy.
And it's a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpleer if you give you feel in eukaryos, like us, you just know the cell and does another in and does another in and do another in and that's what you know when you're reading when it is the clones.
And in the bacterial species is the chromospher, but we have a completely integrated that we have a complete transpllantation of a chromosome transpllant from a cell transplant to another other, and it can activate a cell to another other,
We have a chromospher.
These are about so far from each other.
We added some extra genes so that we could select this chromospher.
We have it taken with anzymes to make all the protein all the protein all the protein the global box.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be very awful avanced in which -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome, the new chromosome,
We even thought he would come to six about to square but we tried to develop the process of what we were trying to develop the process of what we thought that it would be further from it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have taken a second chromosphered or a third thousands of property in one time with the species.
People that evolution evolved as if one set evolved not much biology.
There are enzymes that are enzymes that are called called DNA.
And the chromospher, it was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome, we put in it,
It was expressing, and it recognize the other chromosphered as a strange of material, and so that we had finally the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue because he was blue because of the genes that we had it.
And in very short time disappeared all the characteristics of one species, and changed he completely completely new software that we put in the cell software that we put in the cell.
All protein changed the membranes changed -- when we dilaunched the genetic code was changed.
This is a power than clinks like genomical alchemistry, but we're stating, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change fundamentally change.
Good, I've already paid that this is not a creation -- this is prevent for 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid paid that we may be paid to be a new version of Cambric explosion of Camban explosion that there are big scale, based on this digital new species of call,
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it needs to do is need.
We're going to go insquictly six-a-half billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my contex: I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planet---
for each one of us that lived in 1946; within 40 years, that there are four there.
We have distincluded with food, with the care water, medicine, fuel for the six-and-half billion.
And that's being hard to do that for now.
We use five billion college of college five billion vession.
That's 100 milos per day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever, or whatever process than also that is a huge challenge challenge inches are getting a huge challenge of challenge intent.
Then of course, all these carbon dioxide of the stice that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere.
And in all our world's discoveries we have a database of all our world that I would like to see as the designer components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is prevented out of diversity coming out of the diversity that has come from there.
We're predicted by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques now, thanks to do very quickly as called combination genomics to do combination genomics to do supposed to do so much.
We now have the potential to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the transformation of 20 million different genes or tries to optimate processes to produce octor to produce octor to produce octor of medicine, new vaccins, we can change a little team than in the last 20 years.
And it's just a lot of selection.
We can select for life-fatbulbly field, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen maph of what real design, and you can actually get to work on the computer and you can actually go on the computer and a new kind of on the computer of computer.
We don't know person how it will see out of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code from disease.
We focus on four generation now four generation of fuels.
On the front of you have seed, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of sugar, like sugar, to more high-fueling fuels like octor more fueling or different kinds of buttanol of butano.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food price without the food price is to reduce the available to reduce as we start with CO2 as his food supposed to design that we do cells that we do the first fourth generation of that we do the first fourth generation and we think we do the first fourth generation in about 18 months and we think we are the first time in about 18 months.
And sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries of discovery.
This is an organizm that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the depth, about 2.5 miles depth, in coking hete temperatural.
It is methane of CO2 with molecular water sources as energy sources as energy source source.
We're looking at the way we can take CO2 we can take some easy through pipipy through the CO2 to factory fabric where that CO2 to field, to send this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to take out of the basal question: "What is life?"
We have realities that we have a dealed dealing the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can't do this, where you can't do this,
And it's a important energy source.
But we're also now now now to use these tools to be able to think, is to think about serious series to think.
This year there was the flu, we always have a little bit behind the facts when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change from textomorrow.
Here you see how the future can see what the future is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eukaryota.
We're still ahearing from people.
Our goal is certainly to make a chance to survive for a long enough to survive to do that may be able to do that might be able to do that may be able to do that we have a chance to do that we can make a chance to do that maybe you can make a chance for a long time.
What I want to show you as a first quickly, the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft for Microsof, this is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a surrounded in which you locally or at the distance with immense amounts of visual data can work in the way.
We look at the way here we look at digital images and can be able to stay in the sace on and challenge and challenge to our lives, and the sorts to our lives, and the sorts to our lives.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the bottom of the collections or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is the 300 megapixel and is the 300 megapixel of the Library camer's
It all makes nothing because it would be influence in a third of the prestations on a third of the same way that pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture
This is a completely book, a example of non-picture data.
This is the grauce of Dickens. Every colun is a head-a headd-chap.
To point that it is really textest is that we can do something something that we can do something that is really text, to show that this is really text, this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a book of read book in a front of the way to read a hall.
I wouldn't get it.
This is a realistically. This is a little bit of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a substance of the substance of the part.
This is really a fun, you really really fun, and the experience of a real paper or heads, which is actually a scale memore.
We also have something done with the corner of this except of The Guardian.
We have a nor adversation of high-resolution -- much more than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have involved information --
If you want to see the potential of this car seeing you here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen through the screen through the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the constraints of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen that we can do the screen of hands,
We don't hope that this is not pop-ups more flawwwo -- not need to be more fall.
Of course are landmaps a single of our country, which is a technology like this one, I will not spend up here for a technology as this is a lot of time we can also spend a lot of these field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
on top of the top of the NASA picture of the NASA
Now let's look at something different.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can see it.
This project is called Photosynth, which two techniques together with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision research with Noah Snavely, provening University of Washington, read by Steve Seitz at University on University on University on University on University on University on University of Washington and the University of Washingtor is on the University at University
and Rick Sbiski at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's meant to the Web.
When we do this, you see that we see that we can experience the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution.
The space shake of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have brought together with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- the Grassi Lakes -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes -- and all these things are refitted diassified dish diassified as well.
I don't know sure or there is time, other environments.
There are more than that there are a lot of space that are more space.
I want to like to be one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked in my head is the communicate of communicate -- to the communicate what I have in my head is the reality of these technique of the environments in our website.
We had to have to be hold with the lawyers and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just get to figure out Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get you in the same thing like this.
And each of these orange chicken a picture that turns out to be part of this model that turned part of this model that turns out to be part of this model that turns out to be part of this model that turns out to be part of this model that turns out to be part of this model that turns out to be part of this model that turns out to be part of this model that turned part of this model that turned out to be part of this model that turned out to be part of this model that turned out to be part of this model that turned out to be part of this one of
And so all these are Flickr images, which are copied in this way of copied in this way that are small copied in this way in this way that are in this way that are copied in this way that are these things that are in these way in this way that are these way in this way that are all the time.
And we can do a simple way way we can do it.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever worked at Microsoft
It's overwhelming here is so defined to be so under this.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are cameras -- all of guns of the mirrors of them, a large number of these, a large number of thing,
I'll try to find some strange some strange images.
There are so many includes so much by faces and so on.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photos --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also churns out by the program.
If we have taken through the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data -- from the whole collective memory of the entive seats -- and the Earth, the Earth, the Earth is looks like this.
All these photos are considered with each other, and shape together than the som of the parts.
You have a model that is from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the entire Earth.
And as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the work of work Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it when they use it as it is growing the prepared for people who use it.
Their own photographs are predicting metap-data that somebody else inved.
If anybody would want to clide all these sacks, and their names and their names is getting the Notre Dame is riched with all these data, and that can I use as a access that metape that metap-versum processed that metape veral -- create a kind of cross and created social experience.
And of course, is the be-product of this imments richcheese virtually model of any interesting place on Earth, which is not only from air photographs, satellits, and other applications is destroyed from the college of collective --
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Hab I understood that what you make software possible on a day, in the next years, all of the images that are dealed by everyone in the world that can copy together by everyone in the world can copy together by everyone in the world together by everyone in the next years,
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered.
It creats create your wise, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the images.
And that is getting involved when you think about the richchcheal-in-mantic information that many of these images are available information that many of these images are available to have many of these images that much of these images are available to do much about this imagery of semantic information that is available to do much of these images that much of these images that much of these images that are available information that is available to do much of these imagingining.
When you look for imagine, you know, you feel a search, you feel a search, and the test on the webpage on the weber on the web page of information about what the image represent.
What if now is that copied is to care about all your images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount wealth richchcheer that comes from that predictor comes from that predictable.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefeliciand.
One of the intense pleasures of enographical research is the potential to live between them that have not forget to live between them in the wind, who are not forward in the wind, the touch, the touched stockped in the wind, the touches of profiters.
The science that Jaaguar-shamans still prevent the Milky galaxis still the mythes of Inextent with meaning the Himalaya boodhood at the Himalay still making junky on the air of Dhar, you remember that we have really cut from the anthropology, the world in which we have not a sure of the stuff in absolutely sight, but is not a severnment of the stuff,
The result of a fun set apply set of choices that create our generations ago.
Of course, we all share the same death restified departnership children in the world.
We all make all inferrs through inferrs
And in order with the inevital dispures by dead.
So it can't surprise that we all six of them, dancing and art.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the ritm of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the U.d-Curne, or the Caitium or the freeders in the Kaisutti in North Kaia, the Curban in-Kaitia, the Curban reai in the heart of Sahar. This is the Caravanavanahe's, or a majahead or a majake -- or a head of Qauriacolimgns --
Everest, the go-frin-mother of the world.
They all are us all that we can think different, otherwise, we can think, otherwise on Earth.
If you think about it, this idea you can only give you a lot of it.
Samen forms the intelligentable cultural and cultural life that the planet and cultural life that the planet and cultural life is as important as the biological life web as the biological life web of the biological life web of the biological life web of the world is the planet is the biospiritual and the planet is the planet is the planet and the planet is the planet as important as the planet, the planet is as the biological life that the planet is the planet is the planet,
This cultural life sweb you can imagine as a foot nosfer as a fall.
The foot of the foot of the foot of all the thought of all the thought of all the thought of all thoughts, myths, and inspirations and inspirations that are conscious inspirations that are consciousness by the human consciousness.
The foot is the big nalatic nalatic of humanity.
And she's the symbol of all of that we can be and all of all of that we can be as amazing newsighborhood.
And not like the biosphere is swhere told is the foot is the fooket -- and a lot of larger mate.
No biologist, now, it would be able to work that least half of all kinds of the species on the point of extincludes on the point of state, because it's simply not true.
And the most apocalyptical scenario scenario scenario scenario scenario scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing of this is the loss.
And when everybody here was born on Earth was born sixesthousand of languages,
A language is more than her word-scene or her grammatical rules.
A language is a tool, of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that the sicl of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century ancient old -- a dished of a section of spiritual opportunities.
And from that six-thousand of those days is the day half of not that in children of that are not fluistered in children of being fluistered in children
They are not required not longer add to be told.
Effective that means that unless a change that they are death that they are death all death

So what I really want to do is you to take you on a short journey by the etnos; that has to be a picture of what in fact, which has been gotten a picture of what in fact,
And many of us that when I have forgotten about "another way of face, I also really really mean, I also really mean,

And in order to understand what we can understand to understand what to do is about this particular belief about this particular fairly belief -- that no cult magic.
It's a complex metaphysical worldview, very interesting -- very interesting.

One continent is always considered to have money, from the and, from the response that Africa was not religiously, they had this not.
And it's simply just the destills of this depths of religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora during device.
What voodoo is so interesting is the living is the living between the lives and do.
The lives are bars the mind of mine.
The mind can be involved from the Great Water, answering the dancer of the life that the life is moving in the soul of the life is moved in that one schiterating that one schiterating the god.
And that's why foodestists are definitely going to say to the church and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and be God." And because you are so involved by the mind, what can you happen to happen in the mind?
This leads to a amazing transfer follows in trance that streffelectrical bunning cols.
This is demonstrates the ability of the mind to influence the body is to influence when this in extreme extreme extreme is extreme is extreme is extreme
And of all the follows that I've ever been the Kogi the most extraordinary is a following out of Colombia.
And then stem of Tairona-civilization, which has ever the Caribic coasts of Colombia have populated in the nasleep overing.
And they were involved back in a isolated, in a isololed, that above the cousty flady.
In a blood continent to a blood continent was just this following by the Spaile.
And in fact, they're getting through ritual priester is rather than priester is a raining of the training is a very extraining of the training is a very specific pries:
The young acolites are away in their families when they are three or four are three or four or four are three or four or four there.
They are defined in a world of duisternis, in stone, in stone of the bond-coat foot gles, 18 years.
Two periods of nine years, cooking to the nine months to treat the nine months that they put in the shoot of their mother.
Now they're in the scales of the scoot of the big mother.
These whole time they are getting society values that are required the tunate that only connected the cosmic or ecologically.
This invation with the day that they have to come outside of the day and we are capable of the first time in their lives, if they're 18 to see a Sunning operate, as the Sunder of the first bottom of the son the sharing of the sun, as the Son the son the ship of the shifer is that they have learned in fully following in fully following level in full origin-say-say.
"He? It's like I said you have said.
And it's the real thing is the one. It's not to protect this too protection the older brother.
And they are the younger brothers, which are responsible for destruction of the world.
And on this point is the intuitive is very important.
If we think about inheems and landscape and landscape and we often Rouse and the old factory of the edeliation of the edeliver that racistic in his simplicity.
Or we say stories and say that these people's closer to the size of the Earth station.
Insky-in-sentimentally, are nor soil.
For both is very little space in the malaria moers of the Asmat or in the isense of Tibed winds of Tibe. Desalniance temporary of the Earth's Earth's consciousness of the Earth's Earth, which is based on the idea of the Earth, but at a lot of subtles: the idea that the idea that the idea is that the idea that the way can take on the Earth of the Earth, because of the life-device.
What does that? It means that a little child from the Andes, that is a little child that is a Apu-mine that the mountain a foundly that his or her feet will be a fundamental other relationship that will be a little child shed that will have been a little child in Montana, a little child that is a little kid of Montana, is a little child with mine.
Or it the lives of a mind or a lot of it, is irrelevant.
Interestingly the metaphor that defines the conservation between the individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were to get craft to be getting crossing to be getting cket out there.
And that made me another people, I made me a friends of the Kwagiul-friends that those bosses the lives of Kuxwhuke, and the Krom's and the Krommed and the Krommmanibal minds.
These minds are important during their Hamatsa-in-inducation.
And when you start the idea that these cultures can create different realities of realities can be understanding to some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take these plant.
It's a picture that I april year in the North West Amazon nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive response of the shaman.
What ayhouse makes fascinating, is not just the pharmacological potential to it, but how focused on the farmacology is built from two sources.
And so, there is a love that ta-contained carbon and heart heart and heart hears light and light hallucinating light hallucinating.
If you take the plant to take the crafy that a blue room by your consciousness of awareness.
The plant is being mixed with a coffee of a coffee becomes like founds.
The plant wears is powerful tryptamines, narrative because of braserotonine, dimethyptamine, 5-methoxyptamine, 5-methyptamine.
Hab you ever seen the Yanomami as they have snut, that snumber of different kinds that substance of different kinds of methoxydimethyptami ptami ptami ptami ptami,
That powder you take you in blower is like a bladsing from a baro picture, deted, to a sea sea of electricity. This is not a reform of eminsidentity of reality; the creature; the creature.
I was trying to convince my professor, Richard Evan Shultangible -- a man who did the psycheal agency doms in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was paying that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect are intracted doing, because it's not a hallucination to experience the hallucination in the hallucination because they are not oral in the human dark because they are defend by a single in the human darmine in the human darmine -- soxidase.
They can only be oral oral to something that the monoamine of soul.
The fascinating is that the cator of the slide carbon in the lian globe-suppressing mono-suppressing the tryptamine. Imal yourself, how can this follow in a flora of flora of refar species that are connected species that are connected in a biochemical various various various species of the larger than the shape of the shape of the partnership?
We say eufemistic "trial and it is like meaningless, that is demask.
The Indians say: "The plants talk to uns." What does does that? This stem means that? This stem is the Cofan, knowing 17 various distance of ayahuasca, which they can identify all of our eyes as one kind of a kind of circle as one kind of a kind of purposed to us as one kind of a kind of ayahome --
If you ask their taxonomy in map their taxonomy in the map of plants say anything about plants.
You know not know anything else at all?" I said no."
And it turns out to be able to get all 17 species in a night in different towards in different totoonto different towards of singing.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of book, but it's a piece of book,
Now, the problem is that even the problem is that even those sympathics under us are consequences and color, they seems and color, but reduced to a foot in history, but reduced to a foot world, through our world, through the real world, through our world, through the real world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember 300 years to be remember of technological innovations, but earlier as the time we are in order to be innovation, or passive participipes or passive destruction to the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always been sharing a dance with new life opportunity.
Technology is not the problem is not the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians don't stop Sioux indians are not Sioux and treg up as that Americans stop Americans and they were going to be able to be able to be their horse and ways.
It's not change or technology that is not change the integrity of the foot feer endanger.
It dependent face of government.
Where you see in the world, you will notice that it's not the fate of these cultures to disappearing these cultures to disappearing in the world,
These are dynamic living follows is definitely by identify that connects press their appropriate to their appropriate to their appropriate opportunities.
Or this is about the huge of deforestation in the home of the Penan, a nomain South Asian an arge discovers that to the forest, and the previous generation in the forest, and now reduced to the reverse and prostitution to the river, where you can see that the rivers, and prostitution to the river, which is the river, seems that the river, where you can seem to do South Chinese South Chinese South Chinese Cance Chinese Kings regard, where you can sequipper is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is now to do -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- that the rivershabad to go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go

In the case, of the Yanomami are the diseases that are involved in the discovery of discovering of discovery quiet of discovering gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains, where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genocide, the physical excitement of a lot of universal is revice, but eating, noce, the destruction of life is not just distant to be not just display in many areas even viously required, but in many areas as part of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level, until you get on the basic level.
I have a young colleague in West-foot over the country of Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And then when I came in Lhasa was in Lhasa statistics that you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroyed 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.
The dad of my colleague was acknown to the Panchen Lama.
And on the basis of that he was killed the Chinese invasion.
His flutter with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, which brought the people into Nepal brought
His mother became a prisoner because she was rich.
He was the prison the prison when he was two -- he was two -- he was hidden under her rock, because they don't care covered hidden without her nor because they were not cut with no longer and he was could.
The sister that heldhaftist smoky smuch, in a food-cooks.

The pain of Tibet can be wireless, but the freedently of the people of freedented to fall of your food.
And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Would we have a gray world of a gray world or we want to live a color can we have a color or can we have a colored world of diversity,
The big anthropologist, Margaret Mead said that she died that we directly a general amorf world image that we can move into the amorf world image
We would not only see the human imagination are constened to a small thinking, but also we would have been able to expect and forgotten that there are other options.
We can feel not feel in the idea that our kind of just 150,000] years, on Earth.
The Neolitic Revolution, that we gave our agriculture where we gave to the cult of the shaman when the shaman was replaced by proshaman by the proza specialization and we found a surgery, and we found a survive specialization by proshed a specialization by the shape of the soil,
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
And this surfacily history that we have not gives me the idea that we have all the answers that we have all the answers that will come to us to get the next millennia on our path.
If the intelliligenous cultures of the world to people, the response of people, answers to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we are re-in-in-in-in-in-inhaving species, which is a common. And it takes everything to get all the garden and all the gardens to make all the global potentimism.
This picture I have taken on the northern of Baffin Island, when I was taken with Inextended to Instraight you.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always frienly for the Inexcited. In the 1950s, to follow our souversion, in the 1950s, to follow our soutings.
The opa of Olayuck reach.
The family for his life and he was dealready for his life and dealready all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inuit not afraid for the college of the college of them.
The glasser of their sleeking cases of their sleeking in covered in caribooks.
Olayuks the storm was not afraid for the polar to the storm that was the storm that was the storm that was going to get the storm that was the storm that was not afraid for the polar that was the storm that was not afraid for the storm that was say.
He went out, he was showed his breeding blowing sing business and poeped in his hand. When the poop began to women,
And he brought a low-taken on the sides of the sides of the front of the front of the fall.
And when it was solide was a dog of them.
He was unfeled the dog and improvised a hear.
And then the ribs he made a bad thing.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood, and he was disappears includes includes --
And it was not going around with nothing around with nothing in many ways, in many ways, is a lot of the Inuit in and all the income from the world, and all the infollowing people.
In april 1999 Canadian government the Inuit in the entire concerned from a piece of country larger than California and Texas sams us together than Californift.
It's independent. They remember all the so.
It's a amazing example of how a nation enough of nation's enough depencident enough of how a nation is enough of how a nation is enough of the environment.
And finally, I think it's clear to the clear, at least for who is at least for who's home to these highly not far away.
They're somebody's home country.
They are sting for twices of human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of time. And for us all the dreams of these children, just like the dreams, the dreams of these kids, are part of a indeed geography of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely from the idea that politicians never reached anything that politicians never reach.
We think that polemics -- we think that a polemics don't convince that stories can change the world, which we are probably the best we are probably the best we tell the best we are probably about the world, we are probably 35 million times a month, we have been in 156 million times a month-magazines in 156 countries on the world-magazines in a million-audience.
We make a felt to travel to the eat, with our public, with our public, to such a particular cultural places, where the targets that the targets that he sees that hopefully affect for desert response to exhim arm: that this world in a diversity in a diverse of diversity, that we can find a way to live in a multiculal world in a multiculticulal world and pluralistic world in a free world in a fpluralistic world and pluralistic world in a way to exexexist world in a way to existic world in a way to existic world in a way to existic world in a
which all the way that we can contributor can be connected to our consult what we are several sement.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have a book that I have a book in a book of a book of question.
Maybe you see paralls with information from other sources from other sources.
And I also try to explain some of the connecting you may may have mist.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma is adapt, the well-of-single of our neighbors on the highest levels on the highest level, we have to give them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good good at part of the human beings part of the human exist.
And the top of the top of us is freedom to act a higher well-of-insent splacing a higher well-in-in-inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choicicianity.
More choices love people are having more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more well-well-of-making means
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would be survival.
And in fact, this is this dogma, this death,
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
Narly that 175 off-and-bunch of the supermarket, there are in my supermarket cover-virgin oil and twal-virgin oil and twice different treassus have been getting out different birds of the conditional around.
And in that you can make a tiny tiny of the case between 175 species for you, nothing about 175 species for you.
So that's the attempt of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can put your stareoset you, you can put your stareoset of cassetttesple -- cassetttesple radio, surprise --
And in that one electronics you can choose from this number of this number.
You can put six-half million different systems, with parts of parts from that winle.
And so far -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example, communication.
When I was young ago you could all kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't hurt it. You can't bought it. You can't bought it.
And that had the fact that it had never go.
That time is forb.
Today there are a lot of different across these are a lot of different connected.
And in order to cell phones is the diversity imments.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the middle -- that I was takes and cry-break fun and cry-break-fiel-fun fueling fuels.
And you don't have this model that is not in the wincle in the wince-seen that that happens insoon happens.
The consequenc: people come to the store and ask these question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No, no.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do much do.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the attack-more more importantly, this explosive increased choices a fact of choices a fact.
Gealth care, it's not in the United States inagency that you go to the doctor and that you have to do you have to doctells you what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A to do or But, or we can do B do.
And Art this answer.
By has this predicting. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what do you find out of what do you find in the right?
And the doctor says, "A has this prevent and nadless, and nadles;
What do you want to do is doing?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was me what would you do you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you.
And we call that "own input of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision that the heavy of condition of business -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor on is not the best condition to take decision -- the patient.
Good devastated that anywhere on the goal group, because the goal's group, you can't buy them.
Why do we do do do if we don't have them copy copy --
Because they think we think we are going to get to ask our doctor to ask that other branch measure reverse measure.
Our idently, a ingriprice, and it's a ingriprice, is now overnight, as you can see on choices, like you can see on these slide.
Our identity is is about our background
We are often from -- so we often like that, we often want to be a lot of it.
And everyone morning to the consider to be concerned to think what person you want to be able to be concerned
Let's talk about the marriage of the marriage of the family.
There's a time that we had been free-freeze everybody out of the people that you can get so quickly as quickly as quickly as possible to children began to children
The only reality was the only choice with who, not when and what you did did did you what you do did you what you do in it.
Now free everything for the opportunity to the point of the one.
I want to give me particularly intelligent students, which I was going to get less househwork than ear.
They are not dommer or agreed in the early time in the early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Would I whether to do not?
Or I'll wait? Do I wait?
These are all set of questions.
They go through to them have a answer, as this means that they don't have all their homework and by no good number of call.
And they have right. They're important living questions.
And then we get to work. Carl just all that technology is that technology us to work every minute of every minute of every day's day where in the world -- except in the Randolph Ho.
There's one place, by the way, which I love gehealth, where WiF.
I don't think not wherever I want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that that is really choice, which is to reflect us to be asking up to the questions, or not.
We can look at a football of our son our son on the one hand, with us on one hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand.
And even if they all get out of all of these things that we are all the time minute with all kinds of questions, "Am I call this phone answer?
And I am this emails at this email writing?
And even when the answer is "Nee" is, we experience the football of our son in a very different way.
Where we also look at the great, the small, materialistic things -- life style life style of choosing issues.
And this world was the world used to look at the world in the world was early in the world early saw it.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choos;
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad or bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad?
The answer is "Yes."
And we all know what is good about is, so I'm going to talk about what is a bad about is that is bad about it.
That huge choice, two effects, two effects, two effects, two effects on the human beings on the human beings.
And a very contradictation is that the earlier than confreedom,
And with so many choice, people find the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically, a very dramatically, a research to investments in volunteer planning.
A colleague of me was access to investment data, a big policy data from Vanguard, a big policy society with about one million employees about 2,000 vesting about 2,000 vesting conversation of fighting over 2,000 vestigate about 2,000 vestings.
And they discovered that for every decades that for every decade that took the work, the particularly two percent nam.
And in fifty-far, 10 percent less employees than at five percent less employees in five than five than five than five than five than five than five percent of the now?
Because it is at fifth is so hard to choose that people are just to choose that people are just extelling to the next day, and that one, and that on, and that on.
And from the point comes down.
That means not just that people after their pensionation don't have any dream of bread because they have not been enough money because they have not been made a little bit of choice as a little bit so hard so hard that they have been working for them.
And then they were going to have to go to 10,000 dollars a year.
The workly was willing to double their own contribute to double.
And so many choice, so much choice, so much choice.
And I think the world is looks like this.
If it comes to the century to the century to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be recommendous with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we have the laming of our dish and choosing the result of the result than it would be less than the result than the result than the case would be if we had fewer optics.
And there are more than doing that,
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tincluding to the choice was not perfectly the choice is not perfect.
And you ask you in this case, that a other choice would have been better.
This is dried alternative care about it for you getting your choice.
And then it is a break on the folloor, even when it was a good choice that you have even made as a good choice.
How more options, desing to be able to have a single more optional to have uneasier to chose option.
Second reason has to do with substitutional cost of substitutional cost of the substitutional cost of doing with substitutional cost of them.
Dan Gilbert gave in all of how often we depended on the value of things that we depended on the same thing.
If you can inthink, you can inthink, you see many alternative to the attract of all the alternatives that you demote many alternatives you deal with the infront of the alternatives you alternatives you can see many alternatives you alternatives you can see many alternatives you alternatives you can see many alternati
That makes you fewer touches with the alternative that you have chosen chose of the alternative that you have chosen to be bad with the alternative that you have chosen to be choend.
One excuses. For the non-New Yorkers under you.
This is a little bit the stretch of this example.
This is single on vavolcantion in the Hamptons.
They have a though though wound.
They are at a wonderful strand. Straling weather. No human being.
Don't be right? "Don't be the carbon thinks that man, "It's austy.
Everybody in my neighborhood, Manhattan is the city of the city
I could carry my car for the door for the door parkers."
And he's about two weeks to seat two weeks, with the idea that he crimes one of the day parking place.
substitutional cost of the entire we cost of our choice that we have a great choice choice.
The more possibilities are too attract alternative alternatives are there.
And those presenting us as substitutional cost of us as substitutional cost
And one example.
This image stories to a number of points.
And let's go in the right now, and you have to do things not have to consider things that you should not consider to consider things.
And one point is that you can do with any choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice is that you can do other choice other choice other choice is that you can do with any choice other choice is that you can do with any choice other choic.
And all that other has so his attractive cans, which the choice is becomes less attracking.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this square my searching to a new bunch for a new bridge
I turned out to almost always speak of the wirels.
Bet, there was only one kind of stuff, and it bought you couldn't thank you very much. It was not a very similar uncomfortable, but if you the breet, but if you the breedom, felt it was a lot of carrying enough and often enough it was a lot of fall,
And after years I went to the store for a new's front of a new on.
And I said, "Day, I want to get a stuff, this is my me."
And the winter said, "Would you smart fit, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fity?
Do you want to buttton is you stone? Which you were stone?
Do you want to get a breek effect?
Would you be something explaining pipipes, or flink on the pipy." And so he was going on.
I was spraseal stuff from them. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to say the only one."
And he had no idea which was that was a hour-foot all the possible bly bbly connected all the possible bly enough.
And in fact, I remember the store of the wincle with a cross-in-bone bridly passense.
I had done it better. And I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To this to myself, I wrote this on myself, I wrote a book in a book
The reason I don't feel better, with all that choice, was that I started to expect to expect to expect a good speak of a good spirit.
I started without any expectancy, because I just was one kind of spirit knows --
And then it turned out that there were different wars, and one of them would be perfectly perfectly perfectly perfectly in there.
What I was bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I read my bird with my included with my expectations, and that asked me televisible.
How more possibilities people have to have more expectations they have coaded about the deserves of those possibilities.
And that means people are less touple of results, even if it's good results.
Marketings don't know this not.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about that.
And in the really is going to be about that.
Everything was bad everything was bad when everything was bad at the point of the things was bad when everything was bad at the point of the things was bad
Because when everything was bad to people could have a little bit about surprising experiences.
In our modernal society as well as a well as civil as a perfectly perfectly perfectly as well as we have to reach is that something so good when we were invent as we had to do as we have to do as well.
Never we are surprise because our expectations, my expectations, torengineering toweren't high.
The secret of happiness -- the secret you all come -- the secret of happiness is not too much more expect to be too much expect.
I want to do like -- a car biographically elementally a carbiographically elementally a woman who is really fantastic is fantastic is fantastic is fantastic
I didn't have a little less too.
But with less enough are takes good cans.
And finally, when you get a bad bad at the spirit is set when you get a bad of predicting, you can ask why you can you intold why you are inted.
The answer is that case case in that case.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different ones are available and you buy a that is includes to do that responsible?
The answer is just so simple. That's the answer is that you are.
You could make a better choice.
And with hundreds of different ones you don't have a excuse to fale.
So if people are decide, even if the results of those decides, they are very well have been good for their choice.
And they take a little bit of themselves.
In the Western society clinic depression under the younger generations of high-you-generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the youger generations of the youger generations of the youger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the you,
A factor -- not the one of the end, but a significant factor in this explosive incredible of depression and suicial self-factor is that people have been so often television.
And when they try to explain the same time to explain themselves, they give themselves the squate.
So the nettoress, so that we have talked about it, but we have talked about it, but our bads.
And just a contained for a contains.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is getting away that is awful for where you get away to get attacks.
But that's not not the way it is not
It doesn't deal that is not doubt that can choose choose is not choose to be automatically that more choice,
There's a magic foundly choical founds. Wely, I don't know.
But I know that we have been awful for a long time to the point that choice,
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost finished -- a principle that we can keep the best to conserve the best of them.
The choice, in fact, the choice, definitely considered from material overflow.
There are many places on the world, we have heard about where we have heard about where the problem is not so much choice, but it's too much choice, but it's too little choice, but it's too little choice,
So the paradox I speak here with the modern, so that I means that modern, well.
That's frustrate and and this: Steve Levitt has you yesterday you yesterday you yesterday are not helping your child sat at the time. Sun. Sywon't be in your money.
I say you the same thing about this dure, complicated choices -- they don't help no, they don't help to.
They are living less life's living.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all these choices that people have been connecting to do all options, life would have life of those people have been going to be able to get all of those people on it.
And we have lived in it.
That's what economists call a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reversion of well-of-health -- not only poor people -- and that comes by the choices that we have to behavior.
And finally, if you read this image story of the first time you read as a developed human beings saying, "Ac, what knows fish is that fish is that fish you know about it.
