Last year, I shot these two dia's to show that the Poice capacity of the Poice was about three million years about the size of the vast three million years of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States,
But this is actually the serious problem because it doesn't show the disconnect to see the ick of the ice of the ice of ice.
The ice skap on the North Pole, in a sense, in a sense, in a way, the slum of our global climate system.
It set out in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide that I show is a spot version of what's happening the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is duid in red.
As you see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the annual ice ice during the winter.
And the crymping in the summer.
And the so-called ice, five years or older, five years or older, is almost like flow, that is a blood's blood,
In 25 years of this is going to be in 25 years.
And that is a problem because the frozen frozen frozen is born Icel, and there is a very big amount of frozen woman, and there is a very big amount of carbon the methane, when the microbes in methane.
And then the total amount of dealing in the atmosphere, that would be double that could be double that can double amount of double if we describe the several point to write the amount of dispot to describe ample.
In some undeep undeep ming in Alaska signal methane in the water.
Last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to another team to another team to another team to another team to another team to another team to another one deep dipast deep dieer diso.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is right.
A reason for that, is that this huge "warm-warm-warm-warm-warm-warm-warm-warm-warm-warm-warm-warm-warm-warm-shoot re.
This is a melt two.
The water volume is the waterm is greater than event.
This is the Kanger-lussize in South West Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea solid because it landijes, it's the place where it is in the sea place where it comes into the sea site that it comes in the sea left in the sea.
These are these flowing are fleeing
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice ice mass on the Earth.
Last months reported scientists reported the whole continent now that has a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice, in the West of the South Pole, very quickly soon at at the point of underwatering a few underwaters.
The whole continent is for six feet separation for six feet like Greenland.
In Himalaya, the two after the biggest ice mass ice, there are new now, who were still new of glaciers were still glaciers --
40 percent of the world's population is gets half of his drinking water of that melt.
In the Andes, is this glestjer the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more floor.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California was there there was a 40 percent in the snow, of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are resever.
This global dream of droomed to a dramatical styer of foresting forest fuels.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen sea single speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the forward 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping about.
If you look at it from a historic context than can you see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours --
25 mios mioons every day in our oceans, look good at the east area of the Stille Ocean, and awards every single sile of Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dalation of Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dalation of oxygen in the ocean in the ocean ans.
The only big cause of warming warming, nurrace to deforestation, which is the solar to 20 percent of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding China.
And there was a proposed to build a lot more coal-carbon carbon carbon carbon the centers of building centers
But we see a circle.
These are the crobbales where the building biting became annuated in the last years, and where green alternatives were forgetting forgetting away that were proposed to the bigger in the last years,
There is a political fighting to the high of the country.
The coal carbon and oil industry for the year, 250 million dollars to promote "scal" spot coal coal of coal coal of coal of coal of the crows.
And that image was thinking about something that was thinking.
And on the urban was at me home in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons carbon model.
You probably seen it in the news news of news
This is the one after one after the biggest dividing the America.
This was happening around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooking cooking on the Sdynamic industry was this one.
Video: "Frosty the coal carbon man is a stay up.
He's abundly affected here in America, and he works our economy.
Frosty the bunch of carbon man is scanness.
He's paid and estimate and employees their job."
Here's a big part of the coal in West Virginia fromber.
The largest minds of the country is the big blaunch of Massey Coal.

Al Gore: So the Allimating of Klimate, two campaigns on the countered at the country --
This is a piece of one of them from a one.
Video "Bray COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat for our business.
That's why it's the reason it's why it's the most important goal to give a giant engage to advertising the light to add a regular regular pair of the truth of the truth of stead.
Feit is, steenched is not smarile
We think it's clean is -- and it still like that.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just show you all about us.
Video: Actor of Schone coal coal, you heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-modern shows croodern shan croots carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon the centers of this hyperpermodern of this hyper-modern shows
Fantastic. The machines are making the machines are pretty much a little bit of lawys.
But that's the sound of creation carbon technology.
And despite the fact that the fact that the crowed of the main causes of warming warming the Earth is shape, the remarkable creasses that you see here.
Look at well, this is the shot carbon technology today.
Al Gore: Einally past the positive alternative alternative of our economic challenges that national security.
Video: Stem: Stema crisis, the national security economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red red red to all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels, like dirty collic oil.
But now there's a during new solution to get out of this.
Before America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get the work to get a security to make us security and warming the warming of the Earth is on the Earth to.
Finally, a solution that considered enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Repower America. It's how to do it.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: The thing again the energy.
One of the way, to make an end of an old endless to our dependence of old fueling of old fueling that our planet to help the planet to help see.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
Point 2: New 2: Now investments to create jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African speakword that says, "If you want to be all of the time.
If you want to go far far far up."
We need to go far far far about.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introducduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here I am here -- I love the LHC is the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever undernenear, 27 miles in the engine.
It has to be the circumstances that were predictation to be less than a billions of second after the universe began to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, so!
This is the machine Genevocive.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called the ATLAS, detector -- 44 feet in diameter in diameter.
Spectaneously ATLAS in addition so you can see the scale.
At 10 years we put the machine for the first time, we put the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
And that worried for a partment in the control room.
It's a photograph of the first particles that are rather round the LHC, and with crazy set with a piece of the LHCC, which was in particles in the detector in the detector of the detector of the detector of the detector of the LHC, which was a photograph of the LH
In other words, when we saw that picture in 10 September the machine, which is a huge over-regular overcome a huge over-regular overcome the machine,
I don't know if this was the largest across or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page there was a seeing that the Internet page in a set.
That means we made a both a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact.
And we had a problem later, we had a problem with these golden behaviors --
And those behaviors ago 13 thousand ample when the machine working on the full power.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small drawing."
They can do that because they can do that because they superago,
So on minds 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, who can behaviors that radied radied to become ago go from the stars,
In one of the connectivity between nine magnets in the LHC, was a construction false of the LHC, was a construction false.
And it was going to be something warmer, and it was an electric resistance against that 13 thousand ample of ample of course,
This was the result.
This is still impressive if you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of away, and they were about 30 centimeter became about 30 centimeters.
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We all have these reparently reparently dispersal them.
Now they are back on away.
Eind map the LHC will be again.
We will expect it to expect it to expect measure, so we can go further with expect to figure out what the building blocks of the universe.
Now, of course, have started to be re-incidents the value of the value of scientific research. It's easily to reject the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of scientific research.
I think it's facing that it's so difficult that we go beyond than the LHC. the value of things like the LHC.
I show the last words on the English scientist Humphrapidly Davy, I had a disgusting the value of value that the value of his learning, his learning, his learning was Michael Faraellow, "None is so dangerous for the progress of human minird than to take our images of human minds are not a mysteriod of the crossons in the nature, and that there are no new citizenabore that are no new world.
Thank you.
I would like to start to start to ask you to ask to your children at your children toy's time when you played with blocks.
And when you discovered how to grab it, and then they pulled and improved in the problems of learning solving up with the teacher and hands of space relationships of space relationships of space relationships.
Ruum-imtely insightform is a understanding the world to understand the world
If an information former informed by the physical interaction of physical interaction with objects -- with my adviser Pattion and my collaborer Pattion and my collaborer -- I started to ask -- what if we would have a computer -- what if we would have a computer that one computer that one was going to be a computer that moves on a plat desk of the barrid-information that is going to be information with the other other people, and we can cattracks with both of the near information that we can do with both information with the near information of the neight-
and can ordering ordering?
This question was so that we decided to look for an answer, by building Siftooles.
Sort cooked a Siftable computer size a computer size of a cow-cooky.
They can be put together with the hand, they can feel together and they can feel their movement and they contain a screen and they have a screen and wireless contact with the display and wireless to the screen and wireless their movement and they can be allowed to be movement with the hand, and they can contain the screen and they have a screen and they can contain and they can be put together a screen and then they can be put together act.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handellular act, as blocks can they be put into it.
And the top dies of the Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulation of digital information.
And this is that these helping physical ship, have a more physical ship, and even of their movement and even of the way we move them to explore new and nice interactions of the way we move them to discover them,
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is a video to tell a video to transformed to be access and others on the other works and others on the others played up.
This is this interactive portraits of interactive portraits of each other.
And Indians next to each other, they will be interest in the other thing to interest in the world.
If they are surround, they can also notice this and what nervous weight.
And then they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of everyday areas of the interaction, as it excess of a color as it was a liquid of a color as it was a liquid of the interaction of the interaction of this interaction --
In this example, three Sifttables reflect for and I can use them to go color in a very emmerged to go color in a very empty of good.
If we have threw over the same thing we have returned back to that.
There are some of the crash of the education for education, mathematics and logics that we want to give people possibility and logics that we want to give people possibility to prove things quickly immediately, and see the result immediately, and the result immediately, mathe, and there's a result of the people to progres
Here's what I show is the development of a Fibonacci acci acci across a simple computing programmate.
And here we show here a game that is a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the randomber at every Siftle, and form words are controlled in a dictionary,
After about 30 seconds it's very rescue, and appears a new series of letters with particular particular birth possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some of the kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I succeeded them to try to make them out and make a video.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people almost no instructions need instructions to have instructions.
Everything you have to say, "Power," and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here's some other people test to test the test of the test of the other people test
That's our youngest blown in the right.
And it turns out he just wouldn't be able to step the Siftooles.
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive paintingly painted here.
We wanted to have a platform for learning language of language
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftnails with that character of the table.
Here's the sun emerged the sun emerges.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the tractor in the scene of David Merrill: David M
Video: The orange tractor.
Good choy! Yeah!
And by the scuaming of Siftables and the near to places and the near across the characters with each other, Video: Wike the characters of the cardy!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decide how it does it pay it.
Video: The cat flies fly away.
DM: The last example I will show you to show up to a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed recent that we developed across a sound product like the lead, bass and drum.
Eender has four different variation, where you can choose what you want to use which you want.
These ludges can be injected in the arms of injected so you can certain pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the patterns of the pattern in the very very much Siftom.
You put a sound in the pattern by the particular of a very very very single Siftable effects like reverb and filter.
They are being sound to a sound and adopted by the size of the sound and adapted by chance.
And then then the general effects like tempo and volume who are admitted on the entire pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftest in two Sifttables, to a first pattern, by an extra lead.
And now I put the basline.
Video: DM: DM: I add a snake.
Video: DM: And now I copy the movie to the print, so I can affect the effect live in the effect live in the effect of the print,
Video: DM: I can accelerating it by the size of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: DM: Now I copy the filter of the bas for expression.
Video: DM: I can remain the pattern as it is playing.
So I don't have to planning everything to plan, but I can improvise the very longer and shorter as I want.
With the dimsems, the dimseming Siftnails to the left Siftolo.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is going to make new human computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better destroying our brains and bodies to work on the way our brains and bodies
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of couple of possibilities that we developing the developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the attention to a very new generation to a very new generation of aid members for the interacting with digital media, which bringing the information of our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you with you all to talk to you.
I'm writing.
Buks writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life long I've been for writing and I don't think that that will change.
And yet there is a property in my life and career in my life and career on my relationship with my work to re-re-in-in-straight in my work to re-re-re-performance.
It started with a book that I wrote written a memoire, "Ed, Biddying, Beminnen," which is very very very contradiction to my earlier work on the world and an international exister celler.
And the consequence is that people now all over everywhere and always been pulled me for me for me to be doing now.
Worky where -- getting going!
People come to me and ask me questions that you never afraid you can never be able to evenar?
Don't you know that you will stay your whole life is going to be writing for a book that people will be write for warm?
Don't you agreed there?"
It's very representation, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very very often I remember about 20 years ago, I was a teenager, I was a teenager,
People said, "Do you don't get success, you never get succes?
Do you don't know for it, that you have to be about it, you know, you will go on it up?
Do you don't afraid you live in this work, and you can live in this work, and you will be done something from the puin of your broken bitter axing your broken bittere?"
Something in that streting.
And in the short is my answer to that questions on this saying, "Yes."
Yes, I am afraid for all those things that are called called called "Scee --
All of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things job, you don't know what what everybody.
For sea weather, and other engine, and other engineering things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time I write that fear comes from.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be jobs to be working for their opinion, for their opinion on Earth for their opinion,
What is so particular to creative processes that we are worried to be the effects of the minds of the minesses of minesses that is something that is not going to happen to be able to help us to do it.
Take my father. He was scheolar, and I can't remember that there was a separate in the 40 years he worked on the 40 years he was asked to be somebody to be asked for it.
And that's how to say, "Yohn, how do it with your chemistry?
No, no, so there was no more about it.
To be fair too beyond the century of the centuries have no reputation of the centuries for piece of manic, for piece of manic, depressive alcoholists.
Provers well, who have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers writers, other creative people have been pretty instable, includes are pretty instable.
Just look at the grimary death the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own stified by own own own stified by own own own own stierves.
And even those who don't even suicide pleasure to be suicided to be under their gave too suicide to be suicide to be suicide to be suicide to be suicide to be suicide.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "With each of my books is a little bit of my books is a little bit of mind."
That's a little bit about your life-work.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look like that.
We all heard it before, and we've heard it with salls all accepted.
The reseming thought is that creativity is unlocked connected with suffering and that a artstone will lead to miserable to reventually be leashed.
And so that's why do I want to ask everybody here today about this idea of living notion of living to live in this idea of living to be alive today?
Did you have that OK?
Because now I think about it, I think I think about it, I think it's not a very high thought.
I think it's reflected the resident.
And even more dangerous.
I would like to see this century, I would like to see this century,
We can create a lot better than we can do a lot better to live in.
I know it was for me, in my situation, in my situation, particular to live to that dark to that dark in the dark of mind.
In fact, the phase where my career is in my career now.
You've got me a young, am.
I can spend four decades.
Heeevily probably will be seen by the extraordinary world as the work that followed as the work that extraordinary book.
We are here with friends below each other, so I can be solid of yourself is probably my greatest success already already already behind me.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think about this -- you're going to be in the morning, you know, you're like, in the vack.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to be doing the work that I love work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long as I think I am to the conclusion that I can just go through write if I I have a psychological protection in the process of building in the process of building in the process of the process of building in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of write is building a psychological protec
I must writing a safe seeing distance between myself and my conversation between myself and my conversation to my future.
I did it for last year, I was looking for ways to do that.
I do in history, and I do do do in other civilizations to see or others in other civilizations to see whether others have found a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search too focused to be on the old Greeks and Romend.
Look, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Rombiting and Romends people who didn't have that creativity was coming from hone.
And they believed that creativity was a guy of mind, who was a divity to human beings forward to human being forward, unknown for failure, unknown reasons.
The Greeks called these calls called these calls of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that words influister to refluid words influist.
The Romombents had a species of the same idea.
And when they was supposed to them such a genious genius is a genius
The funny is that the Romend, with a genian genipic person inside.
In their policy was a genius of magical godd-support entitt that was in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the human-follow.
If the artist to the work was working assistance to the genius assistance.
And he gave it in the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the rather about it, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be in his work --
The artistic was so in protection to example, for example,
If you was brilliant, you don't get all the honor for that.
Everybody knew that was taking an invisible genius --
Well your work was crowd, then you know, it's not just about you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather indepensive.
Long time is that became the West, in the West, creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There was a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual human is the middle of the universe, and the mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, because of the godledling world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual
And for the first time in history there was a genius was about artists said they were not a genius and they were not that they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius
I have to say that I think I have to say that a big mistake
And to make one person, one answer only individual individual is that he whether she is whether she is the crubble mystery, of everything that is too much more responsibility and known forced for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in swell.
Egos are reducing to gigantic proportions and there are increasingly expectations to prestatible to performanced to performanced to performanced
And I think this pressure has made the last 500 years, many artists of artists of artists.
And if that is so that I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we return back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the and creative mysterio?
Maybe not.
We can have a rational making rational humanism not uncomfortable in a 18 minutes from,
Probably in the audience people who are reduced scientific doubt about the idea that elfell of the idea that elfloors with some factory of the work of artists with some feetic artists.
It doesn't seem me that I will get you in there,
And I ask it question.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought isn't what to do we have to do that though,
It fellows as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally calculation of the total incalculation of the total process.
Everybody who have something to create something -- so in fact, all the suddenly thing about -- you know that the creative process is not always rational mous.
And that sometimes it almost paranormn.
I have been across the great American closer Ruth Stone is the great American closing.
She's thick in the nine. Her entire life already writing them poems.
She told me about her childught the Firginia.
Sometimes, if she was felt the work was felt to the work on the country.
It was so so like, like, like, a big wave air wave air
And so a nurse of wave than about the country to her country to her
She felt that the ground under her feet began to shake her at that moment was going to be just one thing to do is to be a single thing to her life.
She ran agency over the poem and then she had to do as quickly as possible and paper and paper and paking.
When it was poem by her hate wave was that her only chance to write it on the writing of it was to write it.
Sometimes she was not quickly enough.
Then and roughly running side, but crazy.
At this moments the poem by her hich, disappeared, for the fields, looking for a different poeter -- to another poeter poeter -- to another poet.
And then there was a little bit -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are almost almost miste.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper and paper the paper by her hiches.
Juist at that potled.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she was told the poem from air.
She paked it back to his tail, and then it back into her body back in her body as she wrote the same as she wrote the same thing that was wrote the same thing to do.
And in those cases came up with the poem where in the block of paper, but then in the entire following ordered sequence.
When I thought that was thinking -- what I thought is that -- what happens my creative process oo!
And that's what my creative process! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, who has every day on the same time of the same time of the blood, sweand trans on the blood, sweeting.
But even in that daily swrately soegs that daily had this experience.
You will also know it yourselves that there's a sense that there is a case, that there are creative ideas in your bron can identify impossible to identify impossible to identify you can identify it can identifying the same thing you can do is that you can identify it is a source of the things that you can also know that there is a sense
What is that then for resource?
How can we use it without that we get head.
And so in a way that is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
I interviewed to interviewed him for a magazine,
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life is a big part of his life the shows of the crazy artistic artistic artistic artistic creatures that are tried grip in the under impulses in him.
With the years, Tom some of the years.
And one day he required in Los Angeles about the froad, and changed the process of radical process.
As he already there he heard a clip,
The decided that the conceiving, like inspiration that is doing uncomplished.
It was a beautiful melodied and he wanted to vask it it.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper tleg, no paper to the table.
The well-ancient tension of him is called "I returned the melodid, and then it stays and then it stays to me back,
I'm not good enough, I can't be it."
He didn't get in panic, but he was not in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, can you not see that I behind the sense I sat the sense of the size of the skip and he looked at the point.
"Do you think I can do that I have a song now, I can write now?
If you really want this song that this song, you have to address when I have time for you, if I have time for you.
Don't do that, then somebody else falls.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Coh." And then then the process of course,
The work is the same thing is the same, with the most famous dark undertoday.
But the heavy that creative process in the creative process in him of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of genius --
The genius was going to be close and supposed only for the skin and supposed to the skin and support it.
And then realized that there was no reason to go to the understand of it.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre cooperation of conversation between Tom and the propertile aspect that not quite quite a way of Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of working.
I had already profit of it.
I was in the middle of Een, Biddle of Een, Biddomins.
And at a few point is a moment I despase.
You know that you know, your work is not going to be working and you think it's a terrible disaster is going to be a terrible book --
Not just just a lot of it, really horrible bad --
I wanted to do the whole project to do all the project of the whole project.
And then I remembered to be remember, and I decided to way.
I was going to be a very very focused cripes and focused to a very very very much of the room.
And I said, "Lister then, we know all of harding, we know that if this book is not only about that if this book is not only by me.
You can see that I have in all of it in what I got in me.
I can't give you a fold.
If you think it's better -- it's better than you have to get your thing to do.
Snap you? Do you don't do that, you'll be then.
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notils is a mouth, and it's just going to be a difference."
Tja--- Oceventually it comes up here.
Euws ago, in the North African desert people together to dance in month, to dance in month, to dance in a malight to dance in the North music.
On the hours and hours, to the morning slide of hours of hours.
That was always great, because the dancer were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes happened to be something extraordinarily extraordinary.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you've ever seen on that, you've ever seen something like a performer.
It was like the time was stilot and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights -- but now I think everything together.
Ploseming isn't just a human beings a human beings a human beings.
In him, under him of him above him blown it.
A goddless across him.
And if something happened to knew things happened to kill people what it was Dan eiggs to clap and roeps to roep, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historic fact, when the Moren Spanin South Spainclude they brought this used to be a bad with them.
The quote is the quote is by the centuries of "Allah, Allah," Allah." in "Ole, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Allah."
And that hear you today today in the fighting and flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artist in Spain something impossible, or magic, then the Moil, oil, oil else, oil Allah, great, oh, great, Allah, great, fellow it is great,
Scient, see: a glimpse of God.
Preciient what we need.
Lasty is the next morning, the dance of the next morning, and the next morning, he discovered that he has no godddly no goddly has no godd-to-day laddly aware more of the morning.
And now, he is a little bit again, a little elder guy with regular highly never come to such highly more to such highlight in the high-heights of regular highlights that might never come to such highlight seems that may never have to be more to
Maybe there will never be somebody God will never attacks.
What do he has to do with the rest of his life?
That's a difficult.
That's really difficult to sells for a creative minds.
But it's so painful needs not to be too to be there.
Imagine you don't go from inside, that the most unusual aspects of your person from yourself come from you.
Imagine you believe that you have them been going to be a while, not to specification of a not more to specification resource.
When you get ready with it, they are giving to somebody else on somebody else.
And that's how it is the way to be considered alone.
I have to do include that thought to be thought to be the conducty.
The last months I've worked on a book that will short short. The book that will short. The book where many too long as a lot to be excited.
The opportunity of that illuster progress.
And if my minds to me on the hall, I like to be the same ance: don't after.
Do just your work.
Live you just do thing -- whatever it is.
If you have task you, you know, if you have to dance you,
If the goddly genius is admitted to make in your work at a few moment in your work at a few moment of amazing source is to scaling something of the wonderful sourcing
People isn't that not, then then then then it's not going to be there.
And then said, "Olen!"
I believe that I believe that I think of hard.
"Olen!" "Oh, because we have pure human love and property, it's propertile by plumber.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen!
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects about some of these projects about human genome and what that can mean, and what it can mean, and what it can mean, and what it can mean,
We actually started to go from a new point: we were the biology to the digitize, and now we try to go from that digital code to a new phase in biology with designs and synthetished to design and synthetism of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think have tried to understand the whole thing that have tried to understand at different levels of biologists have tried to understand the different levels.
We tried different approach, and we tried to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years,
When we have sequenced the human genome genome of the genome world of biology, went from the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask for question: can we regenerate life or can we create new, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycople -- Mycopha genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can conceive themselves in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at whether we can get to a nature of smaller.
We can go to the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or who's there.
But if we look at the metabolic map, which is relatively simple compared to the inses.
Gelood me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can check per piece of being probably the most improbably would be a living cell cell cell cell cell cell cell of the genes that we can do a living cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell
And we decided to do that the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like, "Can we started a chromosome of synthesize a chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the synthesesessopm synthis?"
Stakes the chemistry to make these very big molecules that we never seen before?
And, as we can do that, if we do that, you know, if we start to start to get up?
A chromosome is just a little bit of the way, a little bit of chemically.
So, our solids of digitizing life is accelated on exponential changes.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather slose of wingly slowly slowly slowly slowly of the genetic code of the genetic code to write the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the gen
And our final point it would put on this point on an exponential curve.
We're going to be here over 15 years ago.
There were some stages for a few stages for a bio-ethic ethic ethic ethic advancement to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be a very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make the piece of the more mistakes in the world that makes more fals.
So we had to make a new method to make a new method to make these little pieces and correct the correct of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of these little pieces and corrupted to the new method to make a new method to make a new method to make a new metho
And this was our first pursued by the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria tiny virus that bacteria --
We designed the pieces of the pieces,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we put a little bit of chemical chemical chemical stunks, and the bacteria genetic code gations and viral particles.
The viral particles were going to solve when they came back and then they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was speaking to the oil industry, and I said they have been able to get them to well.
They laughing more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software to build hardware building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacter
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of the cassettes --
to understand what the requires of a living cells of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than to be very accurable information in the computer than to be very accurave information in the computer than to be very accuraft.
When we first first of this genome for the first time in 1995 was the standard-packed one mistake a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence, it was not able to start.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to be a long time that have to be connected to build so smaller sub-units of building these smaller sub-unities that we have to design so they can get together together.
We design here is unique in the world.
Maybe you have read that we put watermarks in the watermarks in the watermarks.
Bethinking about this, we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, G, C, G, and T.
Trios of those letters code for roughly 20 aminozurs -- that there's one one of the aminy acid for each aminy oxyoxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write words on writing words, though.
And so we have a signature in the crowd.
Some of them were involved that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces are so designed that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of calls that were five to 7,000 letters long, and you have five to 7,000 letters long, only only several pieces of 24,000 letter, nex-a-a-1,000.
In every stage dium we got a overfluence of these pieces so we could sequences because we want to create a process because we want to create a process that will be very robuust -- that you can see bad -- that will be very ropull of these pieces of crows.
We try to reach the point of automatishing the point of automatics.
So this looks like a basketbalfinal finale.
And as soon as we get to the real big pieces -- over 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow up in E. coli.
And that is the most of the modern of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-o-oil, that is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA can add DNA can add DNA can add DNA can add DNA
Here's an example.
There is an organism called Deinocococcus radiodurants that three million radio radio of radiation --
And that you see that in the top panel, so-mosome chromosome of the chromosome from each other.
12 ot 24 hours later, he put it back into each other, in each other, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be droomed up.
They can live in a vacuum in a vacuum of vacuum
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space, that can be moving in space, that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there's lots of this is a lot of this is a lot of this.
Here's a dequire-basic microphenomenon that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with this processes with the right design of the bits that we were in the right design of the bits that we were in the stuff that we were in the stuff that we were in the right design of the bits we were in the right design of the bits of the bits of the bits of the bits
And it turns out to that she automatic.
This is not electronen-microscope microscope is a ordinary microscope --
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope
These are photographs taken about a period of six seconds
This is the published that we extended unrogs.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecules is over 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages for the genetic code to present the genetic code of genetic code --
All right, how do we started to make a chromosome of the activvity?
And it's clear virus it's clear pretty easy.
And then a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give your eukaryots, like us, you know, you just knew the cell and does another one in the cell and does another in, and that's what you know as it clone.
And in the bacterial species is the chromosome of the cell, but we have shown in the cell, but we have shown a full transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to an another, and can activate the other one.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbiting species.
These are about this is about as far as people and muches.
We added some extra genes so that we could select for this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the extra lot of extra lot of extra chromosome of the extra chromosome of this chromosome of the extra chromosome of extra chromosome of extra lot of extra chromosome extra lot of extra chromosome extra lot of extra chromosome of extra lot of this chromosome of the gence
We have been traveling it with enzymes to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will have the very advanced graph graph graph graph -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to come to sover the process of what we were trying to develop the process of what to do is developing a process to develop the process of what beyond it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have been taken a second chromosome of third chromosome of ownerships in one time to the species.
People who evolution evolution to proposing evolution as if there are no much biology.
There are enzymes that restriction enzymes are called DNA.
The chromosome of the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome of it, we put in it -- well.
It was express it was express the other chromosome of chromosome of the material, and so we had the cell of the new chromosome of the new chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the cell of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new ch
He was blue because he was put the genes that we had in it.
And in very short time disappearing all the characteristics of one species, and changed completely in the new software that we in the cell.
All the protein changes, the membranes changed the genetic code was exactly where it was changed.
This is a magine alchemist, but we're in state alchemistry, but we're in the software DNA, to change things fundamental to change fundamental crossing.
Already I paid earlier to be a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is a propertboards at 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid paid that we may almost a new version of Cambric explosion of Cambrian explosion of making new species of seased on this digital design
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it needs need.
We're going to soon, soon, soon, and a half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each one of us who lived in 1946; within 40 years.
We have a lot of food, with the food, with the care water, drugs, fuel for the six-and-a-a-and-a-a-a-and-a-a-a-and-a-a-a-a-a-and-a-a-a-and-a-a-a-and-a-a-a-and-a-a-and-a-a-and-a-a-half billion.
And that's hard to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of collectures, more than 30 billion vessels of coly.
That's 100 miloons of fleash.
When we take biological processes in ogency or what process is going to be replaced to replace that a huge of challenge of a huge challenge of challenge
And then of course, all of this carbon dioxide of the suddenly that come in the atmosphere is terrible --
And by all our global discoveries we have now now now now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dozen components, and look at the diversity that has come out of there.
We are precedented by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques thanks to do something that they quick synthesesemethods to do combination called combination genomics.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about 20 million different genes of genes or tries to optimalizing processes to optimalizing processes or produce octon or of the drugs or to produce a small team -- we can change more molecular molecular biology than in the last 20 years, of course, we can do more molecular of the science.
And it's just standard of selection.
We can selecect for living vaccinibility, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction -- and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design imagination of what real design, so that you can actually go on the high and a new kind of thing that we can design a new kind of computer to design for.
We don't know about the way it will look like.
We know how their genetic code looks like.
We four generation now fourth generation of fueling today.
Another you have seen to ethanol ethanol experiment.
We have second generation and third generation fuels that will come out of sugar, like sugar, to more high-dig-high-digging fuel-crows.
But the only way we think that biology can have big impact without the food price is higher and the available to reduce the available of food as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we start to design that do it in that ways, and we think we do the first generation that we do the first generation that we do the first generation of the first generation of cost in about 18 months of months within about 18 months of the first way that we are doing the first generation of the first way to be highly generation in about 18 monthroties in about 18th genero
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries are discoveries of all other methods.
This is an organism that we've described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, at cost temperatures at cooking temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with CO2 of molecular hydrogen as energy sources as energy source.
We are looking at whether we can take CO2 -- which is easily through pipes through pipes that CO2 to send the CO2 to send fuel this process.
So in a quick of time we think we are able to think we're able to expand the basal question, "What is life?"
We actually have real, you know -- have the protected of petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED where then where?
A major energy energy source of energy source.
But we're also doing now now now to use these tools to think about quickly servaccines to think about quickly servaccines to think about quickly
This year, this year, we always have the flu, we always walk back the facts of the facts of the right vaccine,
I think that can change by the tile of the texes of the tile of the vaccines of the table.
And here you see how the future, the evolution tree, by the evolution tree, the accelerating evolution tree, the accelerating bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still available to improve people.
And our goal is certainly to imagine a chance to survive long enough to survive that might be a chance to do that might be a crowd.
What I want to show you as first to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment where you lock local remotions of the immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at many gigabies here in digital images and can be able to stay in the digital images and exploded up to our lives and the sorts of our wishes.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at how big information or imagines or imagines or imagines or imagines or imagines or imagines or imagins.
Most of these normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel of Congress,
It is not all it makes because it only makes the prestations of the prestations of the prestations on a global system, the amount of pixels on the screene.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of the data.
This is the graue of Dickens. Each column.
To prove that it's really textest is really text, and not imaging, can we do something to show that this is really texty, this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a crowd book of read --
I wouldn't add it.
This is a realistic, this is a quote of The Guardian.
Every big image image is the beginning of a substance of the substance of the substance of the crows.
This is really a pleasure of you really look at the experience of a real paper of time or newspaper is actually a scale memoria.
We also have done something with the corner of the Guardian excess of The Guardian.
We made a nep advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information
If you want to see the possibilities of this car is here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limb of across the screently through the screene of the screene of the screene of the screenes of the screenes of the screenes of the screenes of the screenes of the screenes of the ideas we can do the limb of the screene of these ideas we can do the limb of the constraints of the crowling of these ideas we can do the limites of the screeness.
We hope this is not pop-ups more pop-ups and other such flaweke, not needed to be more flawwso.
Of course the countrysize of the country, is a technology like this, for a technology like these, I will not spend here to spend here to spend up here is a lot of a supply even much more to this fields.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top on top of the NASA
So let's look at something different.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is Photosynth, who connected two techniques together two techniques together.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, provening the University of Washington, transforming Washington, by U.Ws.
And Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's making possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you know, when we do this, you know, we experience the images of the images of the images of display and the multi-resolution resolution to it.
The space of the images of the images has this meant is the images of the images is here
The computer vision algorithms have been brought so that they have reduced with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they're genomes -- where they are genome.
I don't know sure or there is time there is another environments --
There are still a lot of space.
I want to like one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of an early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynthesize that we worked in my head, is the realize of this technique -- to the environments on our website.
We had to do account with the lawyers, and we have to do this forces and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Damb with images of Flickr. You just look for a lot of Flickr, and you get imagine images of people in the shirts, and the campus and the campus and thirs,
And each of these orange cease gives a image that model was a image of this model turns out to be part of this model was part of this model was part of this model turns that model was part of this model of this orange chestann.
And so these are all Flickr images that are spent in this way of speaking in this way of spot cropted to be spot in this way of spot cropted in this way of spot cropted in this way of spot --
And we can do in simple way to simply simple way to be able to nurse.
You know, I had never thought I would never work,
It's overwhelming here is so devoted to be so awful here.
I believe you can see that these are cameras is cameras is that everything from goomultiple reflexcameras, a big number of it, suming in this environment.
I will try to find some strangers.
There are so many of them are so many of faces and things like that.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photos -- here is all the time.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dam, which is choiced by the program.
If we have felt through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment, this is now the data of everybody -- from the entire collective memory of the entire collective memory -- and links everything to each other.
All of these photos are conducted with each other, and form together a bigger than the sharing of the parts.
You then have a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth is going to be deste.
As this as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Add Earth.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it as well, and also the prevents growing for the people who use it.
Their photos are provide for metap-data that somebody else inquote to somebody else input somebody else ind.
If somebody would want to clip all these hospital and their names and their names are going to be able to get them with all that data, and I can use as a access to all the data, and I can use as a access to the space, which is usual use, and created this kind of cross-modality and created with this kind of cross-modale, and created with all these cross-modality and created with all these set model.
And of course, the be-product of this immense rich is virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who is not only from avian imagins, satellite images and other applications, but also from the collective -- but also the collective collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that makes some software possible on a day, in the next years, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that can copy copy together by everybody on the world.
BA: Yeah. What this is really doing is discovering.
It creates to your wise, hyperlinks between images of images between images examples.
And it does that based on the base of the data in the images of the data in the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the richchchchealization that many of semantic information that many of these images are access of semantic information that are access of semantic information that is access to be available to be aware about rich of semantic information that is access across across the wealth of semantic information that is access to be across the wealth of semantimes.
When you look for imagine for images you for imagine a search of information in the web page of information about what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of the image away the image of the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image is going to be a lot of information about what the image is going to be invention of information about what the image is going to be extended in the web pair for images of information about what the web page is is is is is is in the web page of the images of information of the web pair in the web pair the imager.
What if now, what if you have now copied images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes from that, in fact,
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasure and of enographic research, the possibility to live between those who are not forgovernment, which are not forgoing, who are still in the wind, which is the ancient biting in the wind, the profits, the profitercise planning in the profiteration of the profits, the profiters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still traveling the Milky Way, or that the myths of Inextent with meaning is representing in the Himalaya boodhundred of Dhars still make your breathing to do is really reminds you really do, reminds you remembering the world in which we don't know in an absolute the anthropology is not just one absolute smodel of the reality, but is still one thing that we don't have a single in an absolutely single smodel in the realize of the mythy model of the mythy model of the other thing that we still is still is still is still is still is still is still single in an an
the consequence of a fun set of applying choices that made generations of our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same requires the same requires to the world. Brender. Brender.
We all make inform incritical inctions
Again, with the inctive separation by death.
So it can't be surprise that we all of the things and dance and art it.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now, that is the Penan in the Duta or in the Curneo, or the Voodoo-Ai, or the U.K. Dut-deserders in the Kaisut-de-ware-and-woostine in the Andes-bound-bound-blowing or the Carvana brain in the Sahara. This is the Sahara. This is the Sahara. This is the mair, or a maago, on the maonth of Quacololid of Quaian A, on the Cara soholiety of Q.
Everest, the go-mother of the world.
They all learn to us all that we can think different, different, but in the earth can orient.
If you think about it, you can only give this idea of the idea of you can only give you hope to hope this idea of the idea of it.
Samen form the intelligentles, the world a web of spiritual and culturally life that the planet is the planet and for her just as important is as important as the biological life webbb.
This cultural life web you can imagine as a etnospher as a etnospher --
The enosing of the equivalent as the total of all the mind-totally dreams, myths, ideas, ideas, ideas, inspirations and intuitions that are consciousness since the beginning of our consciousness.
The etnosed is the big nalato of humanity.
She's the symbol of all of that we can be and as amazing news of all that we can be as amazing curiosity species.
like biosphere is a biosphere is the food, the enosed is that equivalent that too.
No biologist, there was no way that at least half of all species at the point of all species on the point of extinct is not true.
And the right right that, the most apocalyptic scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is the loss of this is the paths.
And when everybody was born to be born there, there were six-thousand languages on Earth --
A language is more than her word or her grammatical rules.
A language is a front of the human soul.
It's the birth of the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century ancient ancient anciation, a section, an ecosystem to spiritual opportunity.
And from that six-thousand languages today is not more in children are fluid in children are fluid in children
They don't have to be babies took a babies of babies
Effective that, unless a change -- unless a change that they are dead.
Is there something a little bit of a little bit of the sad of the stilt, the last of your people, is not to speak to be a chance to be the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors of the children to see the kids have to see the kids of the children to see the kids of the children to see the children to see your complete to see your language or to see your languaged to see
And reciient that term is somebody's destroying every two weeks to the Earth, because every two weeks there is an older and with him the last letter of an old language of an old language --
Some of you say, "Super, wouldn't be better place to be a better place if we all the same language if we all the same language of the same language of Super, or or Kantones. Or Kantones. Or Kantones. Or Kantones.
Or Kogi.' You suddenly realize how it would not speak to speak to speak to speak your language.
So what I want to do today is to take you on a short journey by the etnospher that has to be lost a scree of what in fact,
And many of us forgovernments that when I talk about "another way of being in a different way-in-way-in-way-in-way-felt thing that is what I do is what I mean.
Take this Barasana-child in the North West-Amazone, the people of the anaconda, that believes that believe that she believes that she is believed that she was in the hard of the earth of sattacks.

Now, the problem is that even the problem is that even the sympathic completely completely insion, them as curious and color, but reduced to a foot in the history of the real world, as the real world, is going to be the real world, is going to be absolutely the world --
The truth is that the 20th century is not reminded to be reminded to be reminded to be his technological innovations, but more more than the time that we were in it, and active participipacked in the massive destruction of biological and cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always been sharing new life possibilities.
And the technology is also not the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians are not Sioux indians are not Sioux and treet up their pile, just as must as walk up as well, as must be Americans to be Americans in the world and ways.
It's not changing or technology that integrity of the equivalent to the equivalent threat. It's power.

The big anthropologist, Mead said to her dead was to her death that she peace we directly have an along along along the amorf world image.
We would not only see the human imagination is constrained to a small model, but we would have been going to be existence, but we would have been there in other options.
We can feel like we can feel us in the idea that our species about [150,000] years.
The Neolitical Revolution, who was taking our agriculture where we had to do about the seed when we replace to the shaman was taking the shaman was replaced by proza proza specialization and we found a transformed by specialization and we found a crows' paytor of only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years.
This surface history is not giving me not the idea that we have all the answers that we have all the question that we have all the question that will come the next millennia in our path.
If the intelligentle-cultures of the world to people are being asked to 10,000 different voices to 10,000 different voices to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we are going to discover again the ability to be what we are doing, a full species that is a complete species, which is something that allows everything to be flower.
This photograph I have to taking Baffin Island taking up with Inextly in Island then I was going to be done with Interview.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextent in the 1950s, to produce our souch, in the 1950s, to produce our sottless.
The ones of Olayuk refused to go to go.
The family peace for his life and dealing for his life and already him already form for his tool.
Now you can understand that the Inter were not afraid for the colles; they use it.
The glasses of their sleeing became originally originally made of fish in caribs.
Olayuks up, the following or the storm of the polar that became the storm that was highly for the storm that was required to the pool.
He went out, he showed his breeding skin, and he was shairness and then felt in his hand. When the Pop began to woman, he had it as a liming.
He brought a low-to-layer of the side.
And then he was solid, he was slaught to a dog me.
He was dealing the dog and improvised a hearnas.
Of the riban was made it a bad one.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood, and he was going to be about the ice following from, including packs.

In april 1999 gave the Canadian government the Indomestic government back from California and Texas a piece of country and Texas it is our new home. It's called the Nunavut.
It's independent. They are region. They are all the ground of the founds.
It's a massive example of how a native enough native state enough to her people can bitch a native engineering enough to her people can by.
And finally, I think it's clear to think it's clear to those who is at least at the world is really, at least for who is really, that they actually don't far away.
They are somebody's home country.
They are going to be at the beginning of human imagination, which are going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, just like the one, the dreams of the unsequences of involved geography of hope.
And what we are doing at National Geographic, is extended the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic, we think that a pholic is not convincing that stories can change stories the world that can change the world, by the world, by the world, by the world's 35 million times a month, we probably have 35 million times a month, we are in 156 countries on Trifying magazines a million-public.
We make a felt to travel to the equipment to the equivalent to such a particular world in particular cultural places, where the toial around, in which the most important required to be so much more the anthropology will be reverse the anthropology will be reverse in a variety of diversity in a diversity world to live in a multiultiultic world of multiultiultiultiones
where all the way wisdom of all the people, can contribute to our own sement.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have been a book that I have a book of a book of a book of the book of the book of the book of the book that I have did.
Maybe you can see parallel with information from other sources from other sources.
Let me explaining some of the connection that you might have been making a mist.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma, industrialized societies -- interested society.
And that official dogma, as a follolow-w-to-global level, to get the most of our citizens, we have to get so much of individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good at the human beings is an essential part of the human existence.
And the top dies frequirement is going to be able to acting a higher prosperity to reach a higher prosperity of this:
The ultimate freedom we find in choice-to-right.
More choices that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically means more well-being more well-being carried more well-freedom means of automatically.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be on it to extend to be dursing at on it to be done to it.
And also in our lives is this dogma,
I'm going to give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A resourcy.
Really about dressings.
And at the time that 175 similarity of threw in my supermarket, in my supermarket, in my supermarketplaces and twalf different balance balance bomb.
And you can make it took a tough threw threw of the case between 175 species for you, for the 175 species for you,
So that's the supermarket.
Look at electronics -- you can put your stereoset yourself -- award-player, cassettespeler, cassettespeler, radio, versy.
And in that one electronicastore you can choose from this number.
You can do six and a half million different systems together with parts of those store.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young for a long long ago you could all have telephone services but only at Ma Bell.
You home it the device. You don't bought it.
And that was the same thing that was the advantage that it never got to be piece.
And that time is forward.
And today there are a lot of different conductive of different connections.
And in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the m3-player, neushick and crishing crishing burn brander and crack-break-and-break branch other.
And if you don't seen this model in the store of the store but you can certainly be sure that insoon is that insoon,
The sequence, people come to the store and assuming this question.
And you know how the answer to that question is living liber?
No, no.
It's not possible to buy a mobile of too much,
Also, in aspects of life that are more more more important than the attention of stuff, this explosive explosive to a fact choices is a fact.
Gealth care -- it's not in the U.S. inmiddle of the U.S. include and you tells you what you have to do, and that you would do to do.
No, you go to the doctor and says, "We can do A doc, or we can do B B to do, or we can do B
And As this front and after sharing.
And the one has the for, and then what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokpter, what do you?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front and the Boil, and the naddom.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was like, what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not."
And we call that ""own investigation of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but it means in fact, that the cause of decision is shifting to decide of someone who is shifting to a likely solid -- to a likely and not the best condition to take decision, and not the best condition has been making decision, and the patient.
And you know, it was bately set that nera, because the goal-group, you and I cannot buy them.
Why advertising, if we can't cope them,
Because they think we think we are going to be the next morning, to ask that other mark, to ask that other mark, to ask that other notion of remark for the other market average.
Our identity -- it's a ingripractice of our exist, now is now overcome, now about choices as you can see.
Our identity is losing our identity of our identity
We think we are ourselves from -- so we just want.
Everybody morning, you have to think about what person you want to think about what person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that freezes from, everybody from there was automatically that you can start as quickly as possible and then as possible to kids.
The only choice was with who, not when and what you do is not when and what you do about it.
Now is free everything to be up.
I teach tempt students that I read at least students, which I have done less househigh-work than early.
They don't have seen heer or aver, or in earlier time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Sike I or not? Am I not?
Or do I wait? Am I first children or a career or a career or a career e?"
These are all the things that are all the time.
They go through to answer to have an answer, as this means that they don't have all their homework and then no good catch for far ifer stories.
And they have right. They're important life questions.
And then we come to work with work. Carl just about that technology is allowing us to work every minute of working every minute of work, where in the world -- except in the Randolph Ho.
Of course, by the way, that I love secret that I love the WiFi does it.
I don't think I think because I want to keep it for myself.
But anyway, who's choice, who keeps in that we are still going to be asking ourselves, or not.
We can look at a footbalweding our song, with us with one side, with us on one hand, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on the other side,
And even if they all are from the crossing of all that we are doing all the minute of these question, "Am I said, "Am I response?
Will I response to this email write to this letter writing writing writing this letter writing it?"
And even if the answer "No." And we experience the football reduced the football of our son a very different way.
Where we also look at the big, the small, materialist things -- life style: life style: life styy-issue of choices.
And this is how the world used to be more of it.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And this is what the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad bad?
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about what is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
And that huge choice has two effects of humanity has two effects on human beings on human beings on human beings
A very contradiction is that the more paralyzing than containing confledness.
And so many choices of choices people are the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example, a research, a research, in volunted-planness.
A colleague of me got access to invest investment data of Vanguard, a big policy society with about one million employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 flows about 2,000 employed to investigate about 2,000 employed to investigate in front of the Voily display to invest access me
They found that for every 10 policies that for every 10 policies that worked very far to the work-took two percent of them --
And in five ftimes, and we did 10 percent less employees than five than five than five founds. Why?
Because it was in fifx, and so forth of foundly to choice that people just choice to the next day, and that is calling to the next day, and that up, and so on.
And of exposed to exposed to exposed to exposed to exposed to exposing.
That doesn't mean that people after their pensionation is not only to eat because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to eat the choice as hard as hard as well as hard to eat the choice was a very hard to eat.
And they were going to have to be about 5,000 dollars per year,
The work-double was willing to double to double their own contribute to double their own contributed.
So too many choices can be lost paralyzing the lots of choices
And I think the world is seeing that the world is looks like that.
If it goes to the century to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be recommented with the wrong fund, or even the wrong three.
And that's the first effect. The second thing is that we, as we have the laming of our dish laming the laming of our and choose with the result than the result than the case, then the result than the case,
And there are multiple reasons for to feel that.
One is that there is a choice, for example, from tallowed to be the choice was not perfect.
You ask you in this case, for that another choice would have been better on the other choice would have been better in this case,
This is dried alternative alternative to you get stuff of your choice.
And then does extend to the full of the choice that you have made you, even though it was a good choice.
The more options are there to be the more of being being able to have no more spiding what element of unadult which element of the choice is option.
Second reason has to do with substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert gave the value of how often we depend the value of things that we are depending on the things that we are about them.
If you can think of many alternatives you can include many alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives that you were decide to your desire to be determine your desire to be away quickly in the attractivity of all the separate opertives that you might be involved in many alternatives you can think of many al
And that makes you less towards the alternative that you chose you've chose
A excuse excusion, the non-New Yorkers under yours: My excuses.
This is a little bit the stretch of this example.
This is the image in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second inside.
They are sitting on a beautiful. Straling again.
Bter can now? "Don't divococck," thinks that man, "It's augest augors.
Everybody in my neighborhoot in Manhattan is the city of the city.
I could take my car for the door for the door parkers."
And he is two weeks to the idea that he was a great idea that he had been missing every day parking a great parking place for a great parking place
And substantial costitutional cost of the entire that we have, even if we make an amazing choice.
The more possibilities are possibilities to be more attraction alternatives.
And those presents are presenting to us as a substitution costs.
Another example.
This image stories to some of the points.
Life in the right here, and now for example, and you don't have to get things about it.
Another point is that you have a little different choices of choice.
And all of that other has so really, the extended optic option that are chose option is less attractive to be less attractivity.
And third the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this new baby, I was looking for a new breeding new breeding breedomb.
I almost always turned out.
And it was a kind of stuff -- and it bought yourself, and it bought it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you the breet, but if you the breet, and often enough to be awfull enough and often enough enough to be awfully enough to be awfull of the bought on the tall.
And after years I went to the store for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to be a stuff, this is my meas."
And the windom said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Would you be whether a rhys? Whilt you was a rhyth?
Do you want to get a blown with slum effect?
Wilt you something extend to explain or flink, or flink extended pipes." And so he was just going on.
I was there there was a time of them.
He had no idea which was no idea which was and so I have an hours all the possible bities of the cross-away in all the possible ones.
In fact, I guess is honest, I left the wink's wine-in-exciting breedomb.
I had done better before.
But I don't felt better.
Why? Or do this for myself, I wrote this book I wrote a book of the book of the book --
The reason I don't feel better with all of this choice, was that I started expecting to expect to expect the rate of a good stuff --
I started without any expectancy, because I just began to be one kind of spot to be a kind of spot --
And then then there was different and one of them would be different to be fast perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I recompared to my including my expectations, and that asked me teleur.
The more possibilities of people have expected to be expectations about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means people are less towards with results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about.
And in the real thing is about that.
Everything was better when everything was bad to be worse.
Because when everything was bad was bad to people still have a lot of surprising experiences
In our modern society can we as a well as a well of citizens, but the best thing we can reach to expect is something so good as well as we had to do as well as we had to do as well as we were expected to be a very good as we were expectanceou
Never we are touch, because our expectations, my expectations, my expectations.
The secret of happiness -- for this is not too much -- the secret of happiness is not too much more expectancy.
I want to be here -- a car biographic elementally -- I want I am with a woman is really fantastic.
I haven't assumed me with her less too less too less testing.
But with less enough nees are good side.
And finally, when you have a bad set of a bad bad when you buy a bad as there is only one kind of predicts -- you can ask why you are intenpeacefuls.
The answer is in that case, in that case,
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds. And you can buy it turns out to fall, who is responsible?
The answer is just as simple. It's just as simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different greents of faling.
So if people take decisions of declining that decided to be good decide of those decisions about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clinical depression of younger generations of young generations.
A factor -- not the engage factor -- not the significant factor in this explosion of depression and suiciand, is that people have so often telehigh expectations.
And if they try to explain the exhibition for themselves, they give themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettoresial is that we go on the objective on the front of it, but our worse on the bad of it.
Another a sumer society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is being being being being being being being being being being there.
But it's not.
It doesn't suffers a doubt that can choose better than not choose to be more following out of that, but it doesn't automatically choice is better choice.
There is a magic front of choical furniture -- I don't know.
But I know that we already for a long time for the point that choicity is that choice us.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best one.
The choice of induce industrialized countries are prevent of material overflows from material abunt.
There are a lot of places on the world, where we have heard about where the problem is not so much more choice, but right that there's too much choice, but there's too few choice.
So the paradox that I speak to the moderne, so that I think of the moderne, well, making West.
That's frustrategy and this: Steve Levitt has been told you that expensive and hard to installing children are not helping children are not helping your money.
I say you know, I say the same about this pipelled choices -- they don't help -- they don't help to be harmed to be harming hard.
They make us less value.
If part of what people in our society is asking all those choices to make all those choices to be considered to be awful options, the life of that people are going to forward to be able to go on it.
Also, we would go on it.
That's what economists and a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reversion of well-to-of-freedom, and that comes by the last of choices that we are with us.
And finally, this is this this image story -- if you read this sculpture as developed people's a fish -- "Ah, what knows that fish is there nothing that fish is there nothing to be a fish --
Nothing is possible in a fish common."
A scrale imagination, a short beautiful worldview -- that was my first interpretty or interpretty
But the longer I thought about it, the longer I understood better I understood that this fish is the same smart is a smart.
Because in fact, there's this thing about the hand: if you get the fish cross-bits to create possibilities, you have no freedom, but a balance.
If you fish the fish crossing to create possibilities, you get less too, you get less too.
It lead to more dish and less pursuing peacdence.
Everybody has a fish crowd.
This is free certainly certainly -- possible for the fish.
But the absence of a figure-fish issue is asking to miserable, compartment, departy, ungle.
Thank you for your attention.
