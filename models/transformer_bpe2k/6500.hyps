We can be the h@@ or@@ d@@ en@@ ce of the g@@ en@@ er@@ g@@ en@@ er@@ , or 5@@ 0 or 5@@ 0 or of the 2@@ 0@@ 0 or th@@ is@@ .

T@@ h@@ at@@ 's 5@@ 0@@ 0 y@@ e@@ ar@@ s than 5@@ 0@@ 0 per@@ c@@ o@@ c@@ o@@ .

We can p@@ l@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve for the s@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ at@@ i@@ on@@ , or s@@ o@@ g@@ ra@@ ph@@ ic@@ al or pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ti@@ ve or pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ti@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, and in@@ c@@ ti@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ s,
This is a s@@ ur@@ e of the p@@ l@@ ac@@ e of the p@@ l@@ an@@ d@@ ing wor@@ k is wor@@ k to wor@@ k that is the wor@@ k that we wor@@ k that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is is to wor@@ k that is a ne@@ w s@@ or@@ t of the ne@@ w p@@ u@@ t@@ er the com@@ p@@ u@@ t@@ er com@@ p@@ u@@ t@@ er the com@@ p@@ u@@ t@@ er wor@@ k@@ s.
We don't know how to see how you don't see the s@@ or@@ t of the l@@ oo@@ k of the l@@ oo@@ k at the l@@ oo@@ k at the s@@ or@@ t of the s@@ er@@ v@@ e@@ n of the s@@ y@@ st@@ .
We know how their pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly l@@ oo@@ k at the c@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ ic@@ al o@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ .
We ne@@ ed to h@@ er@@ e on the g@@ en@@ er@@ g@@ en@@ er@@ at@@ i@@ on@@ ,
O@@ n@@ e of you to l@@ oo@@ k at the l@@ oo@@ k of you to see a s@@ o@@ w@@ n h@@ o@@ w@@ n a s@@ li@@ f@@ e of a s@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ .
We have to t@@ w@@ al@@ k the s@@ o@@ st@@ s that are in@@ v@@ e@@ n that are in@@ ter@@ n@@ ed to s@@ or@@ t of the s@@ or@@ t of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y, and and and and so m@@ u@@ ch more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more than more than more more more more more than more than more than more more more more more more than the s@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts and c@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ s of the s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e or the c@@ ol@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ s.
But the most of the m@@ an@@ i@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ z@@ e can be the f@@ i@@ d@@ e s@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ z@@ e p@@ l@@ a@@ ge and the ne@@ v@@ er of the ne@@ x@@ t and we have to be to st@@ ar@@ d to be to st@@ ar@@ d the ne@@ x@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be to the p@@ l@@ an@@ d@@ ing the wor@@ l@@ d and and the wor@@ l@@ d and the wor@@ l@@ d to the b@@ i@@ g g@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t the f@@ ir@@ st c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the h@@ u@@ m@@ s and the f@@ ir@@ st c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the h@@ o@@ w@@ n and the b@@ i@@ d@@ e and the h@@ o@@ w@@ n and the b@@ i@@ e@@ ve g@@ i@@ ve g@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ ve g@@ en@@ i@@ e@@ d to the b@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ y and the wor@@ d to the wor@@ l@@ d.
And s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ , C@@ O@@ K@@ , this is one of the wor@@ l@@ d -- the wor@@ l@@ d -- the wor@@ l@@ d of the wor@@ l@@ d@@ y s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ve the other ne@@ x@@ t of other other ne@@ t@@ er other other other other ne@@ t@@ ed to other other other other ne@@ e@@ v@@ er other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other ne@@ e@@ ar@@ .
This is a very c@@ or@@ an@@ is@@ i@@ z@@ e that we have to have to 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ .
The le@@ a@@ m of the p@@ l@@ an@@ d@@ en@@ , 2@@ 5 per@@ c@@ ent of 2@@ 5 per@@ c@@ ent of the p@@ u@@ t@@ er s@@ o@@ w@@ n to s@@ o@@ w@@ n to s@@ o@@ w@@ n to s@@ o@@ w@@ n to s@@ o@@ w@@ n to s@@ o@@ w@@ n the p@@ e@@ p@@ l@@ a@@ in@@ .
It has to h@@ er@@ e of C@@ O@@ K@@ , with C@@ ul@@ ul@@ ar of the c@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ s or or of the s@@ ul@@ l@@ at@@ i@@ on@@ .
We are the f@@ a@@ us@@ e or C@@ O@@ K@@ , and C@@ O@@ K@@ , what you can do to be a p@@ l@@ ac@@ e of the p@@ l@@ ac@@ e can can can can can be to p@@ l@@ ac@@ e to be where C@@ a@@ k@@ e C@@ O@@ K@@ , where C@@ O@@ K@@ , and C@@ O@@ K@@ , and c@@ or@@ e to the c@@ ro@@ p@@ s to c@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ ur@@ e to the c@@ o@@ c@@ es@@ s to pro@@ c@@ es@@ s to pro@@ c@@ es@@ s to pro@@ c@@ es@@ s to pro@@ c@@ es@@ s to pro@@ c@@ es@@ s to pro@@ b@@ b@@ le@@ .
So in a c@@ or@@ t of the s@@ k@@ in@@ d of that we st@@ ar@@ t that we have to st@@ ar@@ d the b@@ i@@ st@@ s of the b@@ i@@ g b@@ i@@ g b@@ as@@ si@@ on is that is "@@ W@@ h@@ at is "@@ W@@ h@@ at is that is "@@ W@@ h@@ at is that is that is that is is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is we are we are we are we are to b@@ i@@ g the b@@ i@@ b@@ i@@ al b@@ i@@ st@@ e@@ st@@ e@@ n in the b@@ re@@ d st@@ ar@@ t@@ ed to st@@ ar@@ t the b@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ e that we have to st@@ ar@@ d to st@@ ar@@ d the b@@ i@@ de@@ d b@@ al@@ i@@ b@@ le@@ d the b@@ i@@ g st@@ e@@ st@@ e@
We have to have to have to know the se@@ con@@ d -- you k@@ no@@ w@@ , the p@@ l@@ a@@ ge of the p@@ l@@ ac@@ e c@@ ro@@ s@@ s of the in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ st@@ ri@@ st@@ ri@@ c in@@ st@@ ri@@ c in@@ st@@ ri@@ c s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ .
You don't know what you don't don't don't to you don't know what you don't know what you don't do you k@@ no@@ w@@ ?
A im@@ p@@ or@@ t@@ an@@ t of c@@ or@@ t@@ an@@ t of pro@@ b@@ le@@ m@@ .
But we wor@@ k@@ ed to us@@ ed the b@@ u@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ ons to wor@@ k to wor@@ k to the s@@ er@@ v@@ e@@ n in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ es@@ s.
This was the y@@ e@@ ar@@ s a@@ g@@ a@@ in@@ , and you can be a b@@ it of the b@@ ac@@ e and something to the b@@ ac@@ e of the b@@ ac@@ e c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ e.
I think that can be ch@@ an@@ ge by ch@@ an@@ ge of ch@@ an@@ ge and in@@ ter@@ e@@ st@@ ing the in@@ v@@ in@@ it@@ i@@ e@@ s.
And h@@ er@@ e you can see how the f@@ u@@ l can see the s@@ ur@@ e of the g@@ en@@ er@@ g@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ , and the s@@ y@@ n@@ y@@ n@@ y@@ n@@ di@@ c@@ al s@@ y@@ n@@ di@@ c@@ al s@@ y@@ n@@ y@@ n@@ y@@ n@@ di@@ a@@ , and the in@@ ter@@ i@@ a@@ , and the in@@ ter@@ i@@ a@@ , and the in@@ ter@@ i@@ a@@ , and c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ z@@ ed to s@@ y@@ th@@ .
We have f@@ our f@@ i@@ e@@ ve of the p@@ l@@ ac@@ e of the h@@ u@@ m@@ an of the s@@ or@@ t of the f@@ i@@ e@@ ve of the f@@ a@@ in@@ .
O@@ n@@ e is very l@@ oo@@ k is that we sa@@ y to l@@ oo@@ k at a l@@ on@@ g l@@ oo@@ k to l@@ oo@@ k to l@@ oo@@ k to do that is to do that is to do that is to do you to do to do to do you to do you to do you to do to do you k@@ no@@ w@@ .
W@@ h@@ at I was like to see what I want to see is is the f@@ ir@@ st of the h@@ u@@ m@@ an is a ne@@ w h@@ u@@ m@@ an and ne@@ w ne@@ w ne@@ w ne@@ w ne@@ e@@ v@@ er to M@@ a@@ g@@ o@@ g@@ y to M@@ o@@ to@@ g@@ ra@@ in M@@ o@@ c@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ .
And it's a very s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion or a or of you can st@@ ar@@ d to st@@ ar@@ d with h@@ u@@ m@@ an h@@ o@@ w@@ s of h@@ u@@ m@@ an s@@ ou@@ l@@ d the wor@@ l@@ d.
We have to l@@ oo@@ k at h@@ er@@ e are h@@ er@@ e, and h@@ er@@ e are to the b@@ oo@@ k of the b@@ l@@ in@@ d of the b@@ l@@ in@@ d of the b@@ l@@ in@@ d of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y, and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the s@@ or@@ t and the s@@ or@@ s and and and the s@@ or@@ t and the b@@ ac@@ k and and and and and the s@@ or@@ t of our b@@ a@@ g@@ a@@ in@@ .
And it not like m@@ an@@ y lo@@ t of m@@ an@@ y m@@ an@@ y is how we can we c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ s or or this is or s@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ s or or s@@ ol@@ ve or s@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ le@@ s.
The most of h@@ is of h@@ is the most of h@@ is in@@ cre@@ di@@ c@@ al c@@ am@@ e c@@ am@@ er@@ s of the o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e of the L@@ a@@ st@@ a@@ ge of the L@@ a@@ k@@ e of the L@@ a@@ k@@ e of the C@@ ar@@ a@@ m C@@ ar@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ i@@ z@@ ed and the s@@ on@@ ar@@ y of the c@@ ar@@ t@@ ed in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the p@@ u@@ t of the c@@ a@@ se@@ .

This is a s@@ ol@@ ve s@@ or@@ t of a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the ne@@ w of the ne@@ w of the ne@@ w of the c@@ oun@@ d.

B@@ ec@@ a@@ us@@ e is not to wor@@ k@@ ed to be the wor@@ l@@ d, and c@@ an@@ '@@ t s@@ how we can see this is not to do this is to do this is to see that we do this is to see this is that this is that is not to see this is to see this is that this is not to see this is to see this is a s@@ ur@@ e is not to see this is a s@@ ur@@ fac@@ e.

I don't would not not to t@@ el@@ l it to t@@ el@@ l it to t@@ el@@ l you not to t@@ el@@ l it to t@@ el@@ l it to the f@@ el@@ l of th@@ is@@ .
This is a re@@ al@@ i@@ st@@ ic@@ i@@ st@@ ic@@ i@@ st@@ ic@@ i@@ al of T@@ h@@ an@@ a@@ .
E@@ very g@@ re@@ at the b@@ i@@ g g@@ re@@ at the g@@ ra@@ in the s@@ or@@ t of the de@@ s@@ ig@@ h@@ t of the de@@ s@@ ig@@ h@@ t of a s@@ or@@ t of the de@@ s@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ er of the b@@ l@@ ac@@ e of the b@@ l@@ oo@@ k at g@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h the g@@ re@@ at g@@ re@@ at is g@@ r@@ an@@ ge of the g@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h is a b@@ i@@ g g@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h the g@@ re@@ at the b@@ i@@ g g@@ r@@ en@@ t@@ ur

We al@@ so al@@ so is al@@ so of the h@@ ar@@ d@@ en@@ ce of T@@ h@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ w of the s@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al h@@ o@@ w@@ s of h@@ o@@ w@@ n h@@ o@@ w@@ s -- and m@@ an@@ y h@@ o@@ g@@ y -- and then we have a lo@@ t of the s@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ , and we us@@ e a lo@@ t of in@@ ter@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ at@@ i@@ on@@ .
I@@ f you have to see the m@@ ig@@ h@@ t of these o@@ w@@ an@@ , you can see the h@@ er@@ e.
O@@ r other other p@@ l@@ a@@ y, or other p@@ l@@ a@@ y@@ s or s@@ el@@ ec@@ i@@ al p@@ l@@ ic@@ at@@ i@@ on@@ .
And this is the i@@ de@@ a@@ ge of the s@@ or@@ t of the s@@ or@@ t of the s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n and the s@@ ch@@ oo@@ l@@ s and the s@@ ch@@ oo@@ l@@ .
We don't have n@@ o n@@ o p@@ u@@ p@@ u@@ t more p@@ u@@ p@@ p@@ u@@ t more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more than more than more than more more more more more more more more than not to be more more more more more than more p@@ u@@ p@@ u@@ t more p@@ u@@ t p@@ u@@ t p@@ u@@ p@@ u@@ t more p@@ u@@ p@@ p@@ u@@ t more p@@ u@@ t more p@@ op@@ p@@ u@@ t more p@@ u@@ b@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ .

This are all all of the U@@ .@@ S@@ .

L@@ e@@ t@@ 's l@@ oo@@ k at something to ch@@ an@@ ge th@@ is@@ .
This is al@@ so no@@ w this is no@@ w you to the li@@ g@@ h@@ t no@@ w@@ , you can you k@@ no@@ w@@ , you can b@@ u@@ il@@ d the c@@ oun@@ d.
This is pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t P@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ y@@ n@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ n that c@@ o@@ s@@ y@@ n@@ di@@ c@@ al ne@@ w ne@@ w b@@ ac@@ k to the s@@ y@@ n@@ y@@ n@@ di@@ c@@ es with h@@ er h@@ er h@@ o@@ w@@ n to the c@@ o@@ c@@ es@@ t h@@ o@@ w@@ n P@@ o@@ h@@ o@@ g@@ h@@ t P@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ y@@ n@@ y@@ n@@ y@@ s@@ ig@@ h@@ t h@@ er P@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ o@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ er P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ y@@ n@@ y@@ g@@ h@@ .

The an@@ s@@ w@@ er@@ n is so that is so is so that is so is so that is that is so that is so that is so that is so that is so that is is that is that is the p@@ l@@ a@@ y@@ ing th@@ ing.
You k@@ no@@ w@@ , and they can get a little b@@ it can get th@@ e@@ m@@ .
M@@ y h@@ u@@ m@@ an in@@ d@@ u@@ re@@ s you don't have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to be a c@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ .
