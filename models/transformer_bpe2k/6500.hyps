Fory year, I shot this two dia's set that the pools of the pool, who was the pool, who was the last three million years of the vailable of the VS, with 40, with 40, with 40-center of the United States of the Vorig years.
But this is actually the supposed of this particular problem because it doesn't have the slide of the ice of the early of the early of the early of the early of the early of the early of this specific problem because it was going to be the desert of this specific problem.
The ice skap on the North pool in sequence in a sense of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and crimpt in the shape.
The next desert that I shows is a version of what the deal of what the last 25 years is happened.
And the permanentire educe in the room.
As you see see, set it from dark blay.
That's the year, that's the way.
And the crimpt in the six of the somer.
And so so it was the permanentire years or years or years or year, is a blood of the boddy, that from the body.
And in 25 years is the one of this to this back to this back to this back to this back to this this to this back to this to this back to this to this to this to this in in 25 years is the one of this to this back to this back to this this back to this to this to this back to this to this to this to this to this to this back to this back of this is the one of it.
And that's a problem because the beauthors of North IJzee IJzee IJszee IJzee is a very big amount of wombon and cools become a very big amicrock of microm, by microcks.
And the United with the totale of the total, that could response to the atmosponsion, that can be able to redubble, that can reflect to write the engaged.
In some of some of the indies in Alaska religial in Alaska of of the water.
And then then the Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different of the University of the University Walter of the University Walter in the University of the University of the University of the University of Alaska --
Why! She's to. And the question is echech,
And one reason that is that this huge of that is that this humbers from the novile of the now.
This is a smell twatriver.
The watervolume is echecherate than it.
This is the Kangerlussuastraight in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the seazeespiece because the lands, it's the landscape that is the place where the slowed in the sea.
These stroming nearly fluence.
And the other side of the planet of the planet on the South pool, become the largest of the largest sess.
And then then the main the majorted, scientists that the continent now now a negative evily sbalance.
And I think about the ice is the ice of the South of the South pool very quickly on the squatttacks, with a single of waters.
The whole continent to six meter seespeament of the game of the same time.
And in the Himalaya, the on two years ago, there are now now now now now are new markets a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's world's population of his dreinside of the water of that smell of the water of that smell
In the Andes, this is this glester the brothern of drink water for this stage.
There are more strows.
But when they were going to go out and then the drink water.
In California was a verage of 40 percent in the Sierra.
It comes back in the waterreservices.
And like you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This is the global drywalk to a behavioral style of bosands.
And the number of course, about the whole world is that are instead of the world, and never seen a crazy.
Four times in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely unfortunately.
If you look at the same thing from a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 million ton CO2 eventually 24 hour.
25 mited in every day in our oceans, Kook at the eye of the Stillege of the Stillege of the Stille Oceat the India, and every single of India is a behavioral deal of oxygen of the oceans.
The only big original warming the surface of the earth, which is the recently of the suddenly of the past of the phossil branches.
And I think is a problem and city, and stead is the all of the power problem.
The United States is one of the two largest cheat the hind of China.
And there was a forest to build more more cities of carbon centrales of building and building a lot more cities.
But we see a commeasure.
These are the cities of carbon centrales that was the ban amazed in the last years, and where growth of the past years and where growth of the packs.
There is a political streedone of the gone in our country.
The stead, and oil, and olie-industry gaves 250 million dollars to promove to promove to promove to promove to promove, which is a connectives.
And that picture of me to something about something that I think about something think.
And Rongged was at me in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally model.
You probably see the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news
This is the one after one after the size of the largest of the time in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the cities of the cities of the Ceraged the Kerst was deside.
Video: ""required the cities is a single of carbon on guy.
He's flowing in America, and he was in America, and he carrying our economy growth.
Frosty the citen's paintman is with the day scone.
He was paid and wrong and wrong and work."
Here's a big part of the citenk-cool in West Virginia of daan.
The largest mess, the largest of Massey Coal.
Video: Donknow: "Let me like to be a clearly become like to be a clearly of Al Gore, Harry Rey, they don't know where they don't know where they know where they don't know where they have talked about about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimating two campaign campaign on tools.
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Fideo "By COLwory, we see the climate change.
That's why the reason why the most important thing is to give us a gigantic behaviors to give to the light to the light and the response of the light of the truth of the truth of the truth of cities.
For, instead is not smark.
We find it is that it is -- and it's a little bit of cooperate --
So, you don't make make a climate change.
Let that but on us to gover.
Video: Acteur: Schon: Schone, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's look at this hypermodern that hypermodern scone of cools of cool.
Fantastic! The machines are to make a little bit of lawing.
But that's the sound of scene cools of cools of cools
Our dance the fact that the fit of cities of cities of the most important warming of the major of the earth of the Earth, change the surprise of the Earth's coolools that you see here everything.
Look a good good around this is the scene of cools today.
Al Gore: Einventually past the positive alternative to our economic challenges and that on the building of national vility.
Video: Stem: Stem: Stem: Stem: As the economy, the economy, the climate crisis.
The rock on all this things that is our dependent of phossil fuels, like four collections and inited the rockile and inited oil.
But now there's a durban new solution to this is to crazy.
Fore, America of 100 percent scene of 100 percent of scree --
And a plan to get America to get to get a found, a plan that is made us and the surface of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
And so it turned a solution of ground that is to solve our problems to lock our problems of lock to lock our problems of the way to lock our problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the form of the problems of the form.
Repower America. Our language.
Al Gore: And the last last one.
Video: Stem: Stem: Stem: Stem: Art energy.
And one of the strong ways to make a end of our independent of old old slikely of old shapes that our planet to help our planet to help help our planet to help help to help a end of the parent.
Man: Here's the future of energy system. Wind, health,
Man for 2: Well, you know, we are investments to create good pay to create good past.
Stem: Repower America. Tike to be realistic to be realistic
Al Gore: There is a old African old African old African old Africand, "If you want to be everything.
If you want to go to go to share together."
We need to go to go to go far far to.
Thank you.
Fory year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I was fit back to come back to come back to to come back to how that machine works.
So here I am now. For degenes that there are not waren: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever education, 27 miles in the enombon in the ombon in the ombon in the ombigger in in the ground.
It has to the environments that were able to see, the tunatched than a billilion.
And Enorm ambition, dus!
This is the machine of Genee;
We took the photographs of that left in detectors in detectors that I work. It's detector -- it was work. It's called the ATLAS Sctor -- 44 meter in the diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in the scale that you can see the scale can see the scale.
And on the september of september years, we were going to go to the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of september of the first of september of the first of september of the first of september of september year.
This photograph was by ATLAS.
That is a facest for a facestern in the controlllam.
It's a photograph of the first particularly that helped the LHC ging, and with the crock with a piece of the LHC, which is that are working in the detector in the detector of the tector of the tector of the the tector of the LHC,
And with other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September that we were going to be a huge of the machine is a huge of the point is going to be a huge of the point of the point of September of September that is is the point of the photograph.
I don't know if this the largest future, or done at Google went to Google and saw the internetpage of the internetpage of things that the Internet pages of things that the Internet page of things like to Google the fugest fugest the fugest fugest fugegest the largest future.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact impact impact with it.
And a week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to make this golds.
And that behaviors were 13 thousand of the powers of equired power.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true.
They can do that because they can do that because they can do superatury.
So on min 271 graps, and then then the space between stars, that can behaviors that behavior.
In one of the connect of the needge of thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructify of the needed of the needed of the needed of the nets of the nets of the needed of the news.
And then the turns out something blacking, and there was electrical weightly electrical reach.
This was the result.
This is still inpresent if you realize that that magnets more than 20 ton that magnets more than 20 ton about 30 centers and they were about 30 center
We shaviolence about 50 monked.
We had to try to get them out of story, what we did did it.
We all have been touched parent.
Now they are back on weight.
Eind mouth will be the LHC back back to be the LHC again.
We will go back to and we can go and we can go to making it up in juni or now, so we can go to the challenge of the universal of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, who have insluckes the debate of scientific reseveral reseveral resever. It's to work.
I think it's so hard to think it's so hard to be a little bit of things like the fact that we go to go to the LHC.
I showing the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I think of the deal of the true of the value of the value of his left of his left of his left of the forces of the magine of the forces of human beings for the human beings of our images of our imagineering that are not going to be a new explore of our myself,
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you back to to go back to your child at your child, when you play with blocks with blocks of the blocks of the time.
When you discovered how you to go to graps, they were to put up and became up and described and described the teaching of space and hand, and hand, and trained the space of space.
Rue insize insize is strong of understand the world of the world to understand us.
If a inspired inspired by the nature of physical interaction of physical interaction with my adviseor Pattion and my dester of Kalanithi -- what we started to asking me -- what we could do a computer that if we could be a computer that could be a computer that if we could be a kind of a digital that we can read that the recenter that can be a bad of the environment of the bad of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment of the insponment of the mamamamamamamajor to recentic that that that that that we can we can we can we can can read of the intententententententic intententententententententententententententic that that
and think of order?
This question of us so so so we decided to be a answer, which is to build a single of Siftables.
Cort together, is a Siftable to a interactive computer greater of a cooks.
They can be with the hand they can be able to be able to detect the movement and they were a screen and they were a screen and turn and turn and turn to the circums.
And the guys is the physical hands are just like blocks like blocks to graduce it to graduce the graves.
Boventually Siftables a example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital inform of digital inform of digital inform of digital informs.
And that this is that these homes are a more physical different, and then are of their movements and then the other other than the way we are moving them to be different new and read the way we move to discover over over the way we are different new and discovering the way we are different different new league.
I will start with some of some simple examples of examples.
This Siftable is included to tell a video to tell a video to be able to play a video and other sonce and other, and others have a single cray.
This interactive portraves, are of these interactions.
Indians have been able to each other, they will come to each other.
And if they can be big, they can be able to be this and can be able to become this and become this and become this and become this and become this and can be able to be able to be able to be a and then they can be able to be able to be able to be this and then they can be able to be bough.
And then they feel moving and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of these interactive, the use of these interactive, it of the interactive, like it was a little bit of a single like it was a single like a sing.
In this example of three Siftables of the blocks for and I can use small in a single of good, where they are they become a tempttables where they are going to be become up to go to go to go to go to go to to go and bigger in this exampample of the form --
And if we have been flowed what we went back back to the back.
There are some of crazy capability for the education, mathematics with language and logics and logics and logics that we want to give things to be able to see things that we want to see things that we want to see things that we want to see the result.
And here's -- this is the development of a Fibonaccess programatic programmate.
Here's a spel that a cruising between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the time little, and then then the Siftable, and prised in a words in a words in a wordomb.
Now, after about 30 seconds is very rescue of scue and different.
Thank you.
These are some of the kids on excursion, and I am a Lab, and I am in the Media and make it out of the shape.
They were working on it.
And one of the most interesting things of these future of these approaching is that people needed to have instructions are needed to have instructions of these futures.
All of what you have to say is "Most of what they need to do exactly what they need to do.
Here's some other people on the tests.
That's our both biggest bone;
And I think he was just the Siftables wrote the Siftables well,
For him this was just blow-crazy.
Here's a interactive scaction, this is totally today.
We wanted to learn a platform for the teaching of language of language.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can put new carrors in the scene of the Siftable with that carakters of the table.
Here's the sun of it.
Video: The sion.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene area in the scene area.
Video: The orange tractor.
Goed daan! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And for the scue of Siftables and the nature can put the carakters to each other, he can respond to each other, World World World World World World Ws.
DM: and so are so his story of thesess.
Video: Hellow -- Heleles!
DM: It's a story with a pully.
and he decided to the government.
Video: The cate.
DM: The last last last example that I will show Is a synthesizer and live music and live music that we developed a sound product that every Siftables and pressing the lead, like the lead, and present and present the bass and presses.
Eengone has to be different variatis, which you can see you can use you can use it to use it to use your your want.
This sounds can be in in Siftables are injected the pattern that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the pattern in the pattern in the pattern in the the pattern
You placed a sound in the pattern in the pattern of a lege Siftable to be a controlllenended to be able to move the phillic effects like reverb and filter.
They are become a sound sound and put it by cancer to canc.
Salgemental effects like tempo and volume that are are going to be on the whole pattern.
Let's look at let's look at it.
Video: DM: We started with a leave in two Siftables, to a first pattern in two Siftables, to a extra lead.
And now I place the basline of the basline of the basline of the baslin.
Video: DM: Now I feeing what I feeded to do what I feet.
Video: And now I looked at the filter of the filter of the filter of the past that I can influence.
Video: I can do it very quickly, I can be a very quicks.
Video: DM: Well, now I copy the filter of the bas for what expression.
Video: I can rescree the pattern of the pattern of playing.
I don't need to know everything to planns, but I can make improvisers, and it very long and short short to be very longer and short to be very long and short to be very long and short to be very long and short to planns, but I can make it very long and short all and short.
And I was finally the animals of the converted by the volume Siftable to left cancer.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion, my passion, to make new people, in new people, that are better interfaces that are better interfaces of the way our brain and body.
And today I had to show you one new election in this design building for a few of single in this design that we have developing to develop the development that we are developing in the development that we are developing in the lab.
The dad I want to bring about this is that this only the attace is to a very new generation of the interacters, which is to the interact with digital media, that the information of the way that we want.
I thank you you from hear.
I look at at the way to talk to to you all to talk to talk to to talk to to talk to to talk to to talk to to talk to to talk to to talk to to talk to talk to to talk to talk to talk to to talk to talk to talk to to you.
I'm writing.
Bukkkil, but also a lot of more than data.
My whole life in my life was a lot of write and I don't think that that will change that will change that will change that will change
And yet, there is something that happened in my life and career in my life and career with my relationship with my job with my work with my work to see my job.
It was with a book, I was insides, a memoire: "Extomen," Bidd," Bidd," Bidd," that very in the whole world of work and a whole world of the whole world of the world, and a international word.
And the way is that people are now to go to government and always do it for me --
And so that -- I do do do it!
People are come to me and questions to me and you don't have this success you can never be this success to e?
Do you don't know that you can keep your whole life will be write to write a book, but they will never be a book in the people for warm to learn to be able to be a book to write the whole life for warm.
You don't know there are going to be able to that.
And so the time you know you know.
Well, of course, that I remember that I remember I remember 20 years ago, I was a tiener, when a tiener, I was told me that I was write to be a tiend.
People said, "Ben you don't have have success to get success to be success to get success to get succes?
Do you don't know that bang for education, that you don't have to be able to suppos?
You don't know that you don't know that you live to this work that you have been able to be able to be able to be able to the public of your building on the puin of your building bitter?"
Exckily in that exciting.
And in the short comes to this questions on this notice is to this on this notice of this is to the sing: "Yea."
Yes, I am worked for all those things that are are going to be enough to be enough to be enough to be enough things that are enough that are enough to be enough.
Altime of the time of ally.
But I'm also a lot of other things are are not going to know where everything for everything.
For example, and other engineer, and other things.
But what I write to write the last time to come to the last time to come today.
Is it rational eel?
Is it become somebody is that somebody is to be able to their human being?
What is so so it as a creative processes that we make us to make us the effects of the mind-estess, something that we don't have to be able to do something that happening.
And I call my father. He was screen to be a little bit of remember that there was in the 40 years that there in the 40 years that he was ever ever ever ever ever ever to him or he was not working for it was not a big.
And so I said, "Yes, how is how to you chemicky block?"
No, so it was not about it.
And to be, we were scree to behind by the century ha ha ha ha reputation of study for study of stuff, depressed coholists to be depressed coholists are depressed coholists.
Scheat that we have a kind of reputation.
Not only writers are also able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be instabiout.
Look to the grimmal doctor, you think of the most magnife of the 20th century.
For challenge young, often often by their own future.
And even degenes that doesn't have to be supplord place to be able to be able to be able to be swear.
In the last interview for his doman Mailer: "Met every of my books is a piece of my books of must himself from mself."
That's what to say about to say about you lives.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at more up.
We all heard the first ones and have heard the first of the first time and accepting.
The send sensed that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is a artistate and that a artistate to be able to read to be able to read to read to be ended to read to be able to read to be able to read to be a poor to be read to engaged.
And so I want to ask everybody here today: You can can you with that idea of liv?
And you think OK?
Because I think about a good about good about it I think about it it is not a pretty pretty daught of daught --
I think it was the weather.
And also even though it seem.
I don't like to see that this this century also so good.
We can creative and a lot of better better approach.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, without of the dark to that dark to that dark to the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of it.
Sequales the fase in my career in my career now now is going to be able to be invent.
Go but I was a far. I am a veil.
I can still have four decades of the decades.
And the Hoperable to do everything that is now that I now now now now become the work that are sequence on that extraordinary book.
And we're with friends are with friends -- so I can be able to be able to be able to be my greatest success of the largest success of the point of the point of the point of the point of the power.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think if you think it's like to you know the way to you know to the cheat the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love to the work of working with the work I love to keep the work of work.
And the question is, "He?"
And after after I think I think I can come to the conclusion that I can go to write with write a psychological protection in the process iness involved in the process of the process involvest in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the conclusion of the conclusion as I can just just just just
I have to create the write of the write of the write of me, and my survival and my survival angst for the responsions of the responsions on my future.
I have the last year, I have to ways to ways to do that.
I am in the history. And I mean, and I have to see me in other day's shapes to see or other than a better way way to help people have to help people to help to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My seech tom has building me to the Grieves, and Romens.
Let me because it's a long and invited and involved in it.
In the time of the Griest Griess, and Romening people who are not creativity of henself.
And Men believed that creativity was a goddoman who was a godnment, that of a reververal place.
The Gries called this decisions of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates beliefed that he had a demon that he had a demon that they words influist.
The Romened and had a spectouched idea.
And if they have to them to be a better creative of creative medicative to a "genident.
The grapper is that the Romenon with a genee person on on a bigger person on on the pienced of the Romens.
In their police was a genevily of magical godly entition that are recently in the murs of the poor of the artist.
And a little bit like Dobso-bit.
And when the artistate was the working on the genassistention.
Our facilable to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the deal where I had the first time about had, the psychological protection of you work.
Everybody knows how that in his work in his work in his work
The artisted as in protection to be able to example of nartists for example of nartistate for examples of the artistate cism.
If you were a job b, you don't have the eat the eat.
Everybody knowledge that a invisible gence you had hold.
And you work on the job of your work -- you know, I don't just have to you.
Everybody was knew that you have a night.
Lange time is that that was how to the Wests creativity was proted.
When the Renaissance, and everything -- and everything --
There is a very new idea: the individual ments is the middle of the universe of the universe of the universe and mysters.
Go for mystical weather, invented from the godnment.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity of individual extincluding the individual of individual of the individual of people were there.
And for the first thing in historstories in histories about artists that they were a genet.
I have to say that I have to say that I think I think I have a big fold.
And to show one person on one person on individual individual -- he or they have the cell is the essentially -- the essentially mystery, of everything that godddary, of everything -- that's what the knows -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something that is something that -- that's something that is something much more responsibility for a lot of human psychcheat at a galalale.
Alshed you ask the son in shead.
Egos are become up to gigantic provided to gigantic provided to expectations of prestates.
And I think this present the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists of artists.
And if that's so so that I think is the question question: "What do is "What do is "What do is so so on.
Can we do this different do?
Can we go back to a old beginning to a old beginning of the relationship between the human girs?
Maybe not.
Welliight we can make 500 years rational humanism not to make 500 minutes of speed.
And the probably are in the audience of people who are inspiring scientific ggars have been talking about the idea that front of the idea that flow-support of artists to inspiring and inspiring high-teaching high-teaching teach.
It doesn't seem to me that I think I will get to get to get to get to get to get to to you all of that.
And I ask it it up.
Why not?
Why would we have done that I don't have to do that I don't want to do that I don't have to do that I don't have to move the way to do that that I don't have to move the way to move that I don't move to move the way to do that that I don't have to do that I don't have to do that I don't have to do that I thought.
The folds like all other elections as all other elections of the totally making uncrazy that are contained in the creative process.
And everybody who have to create something has to create -- so in fact, so in fact, so it -- that it doesn't know that the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the cate.
And that some of the name of the paranors of it.
I have untis the great American animal American animal American animal American animage
She's dik in the negentig. Her whole life all life were going to write they did.
She told me about her yourself on the plattely of Virginia.
Sometimes when they were on the followed on the work, and then she was a single of the country.
It was so so then, if there was a big golf air.
And so so I was gold, then then the country to her to her fu.
She feeling that the ground of the ground that was to scue that was to do that her to do that her to do -- and one thing to do to her life.
She ring back to house home, and they had to squickly as quickly as possible to see and paper and see paper and paper to pay and paper and shape.
When it was the desert by her hone was that her hit was that her one cancer to write it on write to write it was to write the shaped by writing.
Sometimes they didn't have enough forward.
And then then then and ring it and running it home.
And in the time to whether it was the sight by her head, and they were seeing in her words -- in her words -- to a different dicheat a different dicheat a different diches.
And so there were going to -- this is that I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the diverny of the nearly mist.
And then she was in house in house to look at and paper, and shaped by her head.
Juist on that moment she had a potlet to pay paint.
And with her other hand, so so so so she told me shaped it from the air.
She was the sight at his strange and then it back back in her body, while she was the surface of the screef.
And in that I came out the diversal that was in my my very very paper in the pap, but then in the major in the major of the gor.
When I thought I thought -- what I thought -- what I thought -- what I thought I thought of creative percent of the creative process of creative percent of --
And so I works my creative process -- I don't have a medium! I don't have medium! I am no medium! I am no mean to do not! I am no tou! I am no touch! I don't have medium! I am no mean of it. I am no mean to work.
I am a mouth of the same time, every day, who are on the same time in the same time, and then transform and transform and transform and shaped and shaped a mess.
But even in that day, I had to have a bit of that I have been a experience of experience of experience
You can also know it to know it knowledge that there are creative ideas in your operate of a brothern that you can be able to think of the entify that you can identify.
What is that then for bron?
How can we use it without that we are working that we are word?
And on a way that we do for our is?
The best contemporaged to think I can think I can think I can think of this is well.
And a few years ago, I was a time I was a time scrift.
We had it government.
To is in fact, a big part of his life life the toonce of the conversation of the crock of the major tried to get out of all the major to get to the instance that are going to get to him in him that in him in him him that in him of the oppull that are in him of the surface of the crocky that are in the increas
And I was the years, Tom to the years of the years.
And on a day he was in Los Angeles Angeles of the strong -- and change the process of the process of the strong of the strong --
And as he heard there was so heard of a fragmentary of a melodie.
The decided of head, like inspiration that is dependent big, crowellend.
It was a beautiful melos and he wanted to fash.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper touch, no ps, no taper at a taper of fact,
The who's spannment took back back to the mes: "I got the meloolid me and then it turned me to be the century shape.
I'm not good enough good enough, I can't do it not."
He didn't have been eched in panick, but he stroroped that whole mental process and destrows.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry and said, "Sorry you can't see that I shaped it on the stud?"
"Do you really do that I can reflect a lost of write that I can write a lost of write that I can write a lost of lost that I can write a love of write now.
If you really want to get this lost of it, you have to go later, you have to do that, if I am time for you have.
And not, not, somebody else will be somebody else.
Go neighbors at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment of love the process of others.
And the work is the same thing with the best of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the
But the sware that creative process that creative process in him of the gent of the gene.
It was going to him up to the house and living the house.
And to go to realized that there was no reason to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to good.
It could also be a wonderful bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the propertent aspect that not helped to be a lot of Tom to be a lot of Tom to be --
And that story that has changed.
I have been a profited of it.
I was in the middle in the write process of Exts, Biddle -- Biddle -- Biddle --
And in a little bit of pointing in power.
You know that that you don't want to do you don't want to be a good bad of the bigger bad book it. It bad books
Not shabad cheat, really really different.
I wanted to do it all of the project of the project of the project of it.
And then I remember Tom who are going to be geneded to be a power.
I killed me from my manuscrid and rid to me to a lege of the room.
And I said heard, "Lister ding, we know that if this book, I don't know that if this book, it's not just by mice.
You can see everything in what I have everything in what I have to have to me.
And I can't feel it.
If you find it better behind can, you have to do your your your thing.
Snap you don't know that not, you don't know that not, you don't know
I write just write because that's not a little bit of my work.
And in the notuls are become more than you have to be able to be able to cantor of the change."
Tja--- Uitself comes to needed here
Eeuwed in the North African whether African wood African wrong people to math, to maance with maanss.
And Uries and hind and back to the ocheat the cheggors.
That was always great dig, because the dances were fullling professionals.
But sometimes happened to be a single of echeching something for it.
And one of those danced than transcending.
You know what I mean, you know, you have to do with this performer.
It was like the time when the danced and the dance and the dance of stap.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights in the thousands of everything.
And so he was not just a huge of the teach.
In hem, on him on him of him him him him
And a godnment, and a godnment.
If something that happened to happen, who was happening people what it was Dan began to clap and in clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Allah, Alla
Because that was the for them.
And so a teach, a teachief: When the Moren Spanish Spanish Spanu Spanu Spanu of the maining of med.
The exactly is eched by the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah."
And that you have to do the day day at today's today's flaments and flaments and flaments
If a artists in Spanu or magical or magical or magical goes, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, bbough."
Our understand it, a glimp.
Presisted what we need to have to have.
Lasty is that the dance of the next morning the next morning to the next morning, he was on the next morning to 11 hours are no godddly laddding more
And on that moment he was a little bit of a bad man with a bad of couldn't be able to be able to be able to come to come to come to come to come to come to come to come to get to come to come to get to come to be a little bit of couple of the well.
Maybe no more somebody will never be more somebody else in the dances.
What has to the rest of his liv?
That's hard.
And that's really hard to sell to sell a creative straint.
But so so that are not to be to be to be to be to be to be so poor.
And if you don't know that the most until of your person of your person of your person of your person from your your your person of your person of your your person of your your person of your your person of your your person of your your person of your your person of your person of your person of your person
And imagine that you believe it you have a time to learn a time to be a time to be able to specificate a time of specifications
When you ready with the class with somebody else to somebody else on somebody else.
And so it describe, everything.
I was invented inverage that I have been done
The last months I have a book, I worked on a book that book that book that that book a lot of time to be able to restore to be choices.
The surprise of that illuster is the illuster of that illuster of the illuster of that illuster of the illuster of that illuster
And if my days with the hall, I love me to me, I still have the same forward me to me. Se: You don't have the same for.
And so you know, you work.
And just you just do, what it is.
If you do do thank ank thank dances, thank ank
If the godnment, if you can shape to decided to shape in your work on the wonderful brother, something of the wonderful brothers, "Ollone"
Geat that not, thank you toward it it was to.
And thank "Ollet me "Ollet
I believe that I believe of hear.
"Olet "Olned, because we can go from pure human love and property of human love and properttish.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olon!
You know, I have been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discovers of new sets of new sets of new sets of new sets of new sexes.
We actually actually actually from a new point of the digital of the digital code of the digital code to a new physical code to a new physical code in biology and synthetism of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions to ask the big questions
"What is something that I think about what I think about what I think about a lot of biolos,
We have different approach, we tried to less animal components.
We're now now now now now 20 years of the digitalizing to the digitalization of the digitalization.
When we went from the human genomic sequence, the analoge world of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask to question we can live life to live in life life life to create this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of digital universe of this digital universe of life to do we can life life to do --
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma called Mycoplasma called the colority of that can be able to a kind of that can be able disappeament in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at or we have to look at a nature smaller genome of it.
We can be in the order of hundred gences of the 500 or so on.
But if we look at the metabolc map is that relative simply conversation with the uncrazy.
Geloof me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at the way that we can probably this is a very untrue that this is a living cell that this is a lives.
We decided to prove this is that the only route to this chromosophim to synthetise to synthetise to be able to be able to a few of the most fundamental question to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking with questions of questions like to ask a chromosophind synthetis?"
Staat the chemistry it to make this very big molecular that we never have been going to be a very big molecules that we have seen it to se?
And if we do, if we can do a chromosoph?
And a chromosopm is truly to chemicically, a piece of chemicically,
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is reverstate on exponential evidence.
Our moving the genetic code code of write that is nogal slow-slow-slow-summers.
And our last point to this moment on this moment on this moment on this moment on a exponential curvent of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of us in this
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, and then we have a bio-ethical ethical fuel of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthess.
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that little piece of DNA making 50 to 50 to 50 letters in lengs, so how long you make it stuff, so how more front of the stuff.
So we had to make a new method for the societies of these little piece of all the flows.
And this was our first poging, to begin with the digital information of the genome.
That's a small of four craising bacteria dies.
We have the studying the study, deaded the fine correction,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 liters.
The spanness part of the beginning of chemical stor in the bacteria in the bacteria and the bacteria and shapes and virtual code of making gs and virale particles of gars.
The virtual particles were were in the cells, they were back to the cells, and then then the E. coli.
I was untis in the both industry, and I said they said they said they were to do that model to be able to do that model
They laught more than you lo.
And so we think this is a situation is that this is a situation that can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to be something much great.
We wanted to build the full bacterial bacterial chromosophind to build the ential chromosophine.
That's more 580,000 letters are genetic cod.
And so we decided to build them in cassettch of viruss, so we could be the cassettta cassettts --
And to understand what the deal components of a lives,
The design is crucial and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer that are very accureat that are very accureat the digital information.
When we went to the first thing that we were in 1995 was the standard of the standard of the standard of a 10,000 aseparts.
And then we could we resequencing 30 fits, if we were the wards of the wards of sequences that was not in the ward of the state of the state of the state of the state of the point of the speas.
Our part of the designer is the design of study that are 50 letters are going to governments are with all other studying with all other studying to build and building them so we need to build them together.
We are going to be able to parts of these parts of parts in the parts of these parts are invited in the parts of design.
Maybe you have to be watermers that we have watermers in strong.
Bethink we have a four literal genetic code: A, C, C, C, C, C, C, C,
Trio's from those litters of those litts for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple touching for every aminoxygen is for every aminoxygen
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words,
As a signs we just just asking "Something we just just mic.
Some of the purched that there were no dishead.
We have this studying this studying that we can read them with enzys.
There are some of single that they reparate and put them in each other.
And we started to do stuff, we started to start to start with studying five to 7,000 letters to 7,000 letters to 7,000 letter, and you have to go from 24,000 letter, and you have to 724,000 letter, to 7, to 72,000.
In every stead, we could we have a survive of these stuff, so we could cut them with a process of create and because we could create a process -- that will be very robbit.
We try to do it from automater to reach the point of automates.
So this looks like a basketbalthcrazy.
And so we come to the really big piece of the really stuff, more than 100,000 ased, they don't have so easy more in E.
That expends of all the most of the modern of the molecular biology.
And so we went to read to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination is used by the biology of biology to reparently the biology to reparents of the biology to reparents.
Here's a example of it.
There is a organism ms, Deinococcus radiodurans have three million radiodurance of can.
That you see in the both pane: I think that you can see in the fromosphere of the past of so.
12 ot 24 hours later to go back in the six, precise was like the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of it.
There are thousands of organized organizers that this argument
These organisms can be able to be surface to be equired up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely absolutely that there can exist, that can be able to existence, a new aquatically environment.
And then then you have to see that there are here here here is a lot of thing,
Here's a deal microph of the molecul that we have made with this processes -- fact, fact, fact, fact, fact, which we have been with the right designer of the study.
And then they make it automatically automatically tomatically tomatically society.
This is not a electronen-microscope, this is a microscope.
It's a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope can see it with a light.
These are photographs, are about a period of six seconds.
This is the auication that we insides.
This is more 580,000 letters at genetic cod.
It's the largest molecule molecule of people, with a duce of people, with a duce of the cool.
The molecuulged is more than 300 million.
If we would be able to a 10-point of point of liters, then there is 142 pages of the genetic code code code code code code code code code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of
Good, how do we started to a chromospher? How activit?
And I was a four rus is the suddenly easy.
And I was a bacteria.
It's also simply if you get eukard, like eukard, like eukard, you wouldn't just the celkern and do, and that's what you know if it is what you know if it looks like it to be able to do it as it as it close to be a bone.
And in the bacteria species of the chromosphere in the cell of the cell of the cell transpling a full transplantation of a chromosphere of a chromosphere of a chromosphere and the actives.
We have a chromosed of a chromosed of a micromosed of a micromosed of a micromoses.
These are about so much of these are about so much people and well.
We feeded what extra genes so we could cut for this chromosphere to select this chromoses.
We have the conted, we have to make all the easy stuff.
It was woman as we can state this in the cell -- and you will stop the very avanced images here -- the new chromosophic images -- the new chromosophim in the cell.
We even thought he was to come to sover the process of the process of the process of developed to developed the process of equiping it to develop.
This is a essential evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discoverovered species that are a second chromosphere or a third chromosphere or a third thousands of the tools of the species.
People who are evolution for equired to have a lot of biology to be able to be a lot of biology --
There are enzyms that restrictive enzymists are enough DNA verterms that are working DNA verterms that are restriction.
It was chromosopm that in the cell was not easy.
The cell -- the chromosphere -- which we stop -- which is -- which is --
It was expresent and the recognize the other chromosphere as strange material, and so we had to go out the cell of the new chromosophind to the new chromosoph.
He was blaw from weak the genes that we had straind.
And in very short time to be the carakists of the ene species of the ene species of the new species, and it was completely in the new software that we had to the cell we had strorom.
All of the white changes, the membrans, when we were the genetic code code code that was changed.
This is magine clines like genomics like genomics -- but we are in state, by change the software DNA, to change things that is to change things that is change.
And I have been paying all of the Camic -- this is not a screepping -- this is excited on 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I have a new version, and I have a new version of the Camic explosion of the Caman explosic new species of the Camic new species on this digital design in this digital of design in this digital new species on this digital new species of design.
Why do you do?
And I think it's woman is that you look at what you look at what it is.
We're going to go to the ses-simple of six years, during the next 40 years, during the next 40 years.
And to go to place, I am in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet...
And every one of us that in 1940; within 1940 years that are four years.
We have to food with food with the conversation of scree water, medicine, fluence for the ses-half billion.
That is very much to do that for that for next.
We use five billion ton colles, more 30 billion flions of fat.
That's 100 millions of os and fat.
When we have biological processes in ogence or while to be able to reflect that is a huge of the way that is a huge of day.
And then of course, there is all those carbon dioxide of the stone that in the atmosphere.
And for all our worldwell, we have to see a database of about 20 million genes, and I see a way as the designer components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dohis different components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is present from the anims.
We're predicdicated by a biological reality and our except of our imagination.
We don't have technique technique to do a lot of cell to do so genome to do so that we have to do so cells to do it.
We have to build a big robot to build a great robot that a million chromosomes a day can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes can make a million chromosomes that can make a great robot.
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes to optimalizing to make occatch or to make occins, new vaccins, new vacs, new vacs, we can change with a little team of team to do with a tiny than the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can select for lives, chemical or branchemical or brandstopers, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real design, so you can really get to work, so you can really go to the gang and a new kind of the computer and a new kind of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what we can design in the computer of the computer of what we can design the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what we can can design in the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computttttotototototototototom of the gang is is is is
We don't know person how it will see it from it.
We know precise how their genetic code of disease.
We read us on four generation of shapes in our generation of shape.
Our gone of you have to ethanol you see a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that are going to come from come from come from come from come from come to more and more high and like occasures like occtory or different species of butano.
But the only way we think that biology is great invluence that biology can have a lot of food and the describes and the describes and the describes of CO2 as are food to CO2 as are food and so we see the way that we think that we think we think that the way that we think we think that the way we think we think we think that the first generation and then we have to have to be able to be able to be able to be able to suncell.
Sonlide and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwell, we have all the discoverovers -- we have all other method.
This is a organism that we have been reven in 1996.
It lives in the deep see, about 2.5 miles of silometers -- at coals.
It makes methon CO2 with the molecular water of molecular waterstor as energy squate.
We're looking at the looking at CO2 and look at CO2 easy to four easy to fabries that CO2 becomes back to fabries that CO2 to brand-stom, to bring this process to sturb.
So in a short time we think we are in a short time we are in the basal question of the basal question of the basic question is liv?"
We have work, you know, you have the teaches of deaths the petrochemical industry industry of it.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED -- where then do you can't do, where then do do it in TED
A important energy brother.
But we are also now now now now now to be able to do these worth is to be able to think.
This was the griculture, we always just like to the fact the fact of the fact of the flow-faccin.
I think that can change that can change from teaching teachievaccess to make faccinate vaccess
And here's how the future of the future of evolution, the evolution, the response of evolution, the reququickly, and eventually eukard, and eventually eukary.
We're still farmers of people's evital of people.
Our goal is certainly that we make a chance to survive to survival that that can do you can do that that I think that that I think that that I think that that I can do a chance to do that that we have a chance to do that that that we do a chance to do that that we do a chance of it.
What I want to show you if you want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft of Microsoft to
And it's a circle of you love in the way of deastate of deathly fish data can work.
We look at many of digital images of digital images and can stay here and can keep here and look at the backwards and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and to our our lives.
And it doesn't make a lot of information we look at how big this collections are images or images or images are images or images are images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images are of how big information.
And most of the most of this are normal camera photographs, but this is a single shape of the Library or Congress, and sit in the 300 megapixel of the Librings.
It doesn't make nothing that because it was going to be able to be influence, on a third system, the am, the am, the am, the am, the skills on the screen on the screen on the screen on the screen of the screen.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a full book, a example of notice image data.
This is the graue of Dickens. Elke to Dickens. Elke is a headd stuff.
And to evidence that it was working is to be able to show you something do, we can see something do, to show that this is really tect to be able to be able to be a imagination.
And maybe this is a telling way to read a way to leave a book of it.
I don't have it to do it in the time.
This is a realisticer example. This is a challenge of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a deal.
This is to this place to the place and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or crowwhether is actually a scaling medium is actually a scaling of medium
We also have something that done with the nek of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertention of high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information of information -- and we have extra information of information -- and we have extra of advertention -- and we have a normal adversy.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to do that we can do the decisiet of hands can do the screen to do the screen.
We have no popular more popular of things that are more means and other third -- not more more than be more than be more than be more more than be more than be more than be more than be more than be more than be.
Well, of course, of course, are agrands a for hand is a time of the future of the contained of the single of playing this fellow is that we can also have a lot of the behavided more for this fellow of the behavior.
These are all the U.SS.
And then the folds on a image of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way to the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is Photosynth, who are two techniques two techniques.
And one of Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful study of computer fish study by Noah Snanac promove to the University of Washington,
and Rick Sicrosoft Research. A beautiful tools. A beautiful society.
So this is the Web. It's a little b. It's measure.
When we do, this do, we see this is how we see by the images and the multi-resolution resolution experiences.
The space of the images of the images has to have this mean,
The computer vision of the computer of the images have these images are building together, so they are connected to the Grassi Lakes in the Canades -- where they are going to see the Canades of stabilized images of stabilized images and all these things are the space.
I don't know about it or there is time to show you another time --
There are many of the space of space.
I want to like to be a of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth that we have this single of Photosynth that we have to see what I have to do this this is the single of the things that look at the environment, the one of our environment.
We had to do to read with the advocate of advocate and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notrackable to image things from Flickr. You look at Flicket at Flicks, and you get images of people in Flicks, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the Acampus of the Notracks.
And every one of these orange chices a image of this model that are part of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model to be a image that are a deal of this model of this model of this model of this orange of the orange of this orange that are a picture.
And so so are all this Flicks, which are these things that are on this way of space are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be this way in the way of cope.
And we can be on simple evidence they took to figinal education.
And I had never thought I had to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft
It's very explored here so it is so much to be so much to be so much to be so much of it.
I believe you can see that this many types of camera's camera's sople to spired to spoke to spireflexing in this environment.
I will try to find what strange images to find what strange to find out of the images
There are so much better than it taken by seeing the way and equiping and equipy of seeing and third it became so much better than it.
And now, in this is even a series of photographs -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notracky that are also churposter is by the program.
If we have four four poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say to say is that we can do with social environment. This is now the data of everybody -- from the whole collective -- from the whole whole of the shaure, the Aart of how to see it looks like everything to do to each other.
All this pictures are with each other, and shapes and shapes is a very little bigger than the slight of the bigger than the slight.
You have a model that from the whole Aart of the Earth th
And so this as a contain Stephen Lawler's work the U.S.
And this is something that growth in complexity when it uses the use, and where the people who are used for the people who are used to the people who are used to the people who are used the used for the people who are used to the people that are the used for the people who are the uses of the people who are the used for the people who are used to the people who are the usum.
Their own photographs are present data that somebody else.
And if somebody would like to be able to do their names, and their names, then my picture of the Notracks, and then my picture of the Notracks, and that can use it to be a fun to the space, and create that space, and create that that is a photographs, and create this kind of a kind of this kind of social and social in social and social -- and social in social and social to social this is a kind of social of social of social and this kind of social experiencrophototototototototototototototototototototototo
And of course, is the big, is the product of this is a crather than every interest of every interest of the Interterm of the photographs, satelite images and other access is also from the collective and other across the collective of the collective of the collective forces.
Our tell.
Chris Anderson: Heb I started good good beginning that what you can copy software are possible to a days: What do it by everybody on the world that are describe?
BAA: Yeah. What this is discovering is discovering

Thank you very much.
I want to talk about you to talk about some of you ask about the global study.
Maybe you can see paralls with information of information from other brons.
And I tried to explain what I also tried to explain that you have mist.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be able to be, it official dogma of the wester, industrial dogma test society.
And that official doggma air of whether as a followly of our citizers on the high level of our citizers on the gest level of our equal free free of freedom.
Freedom is immers a big good, a great good, a great part of the human exist.
And so we dies and deaths us to treat our own inside, to own inside, to do a hoger while major making a single of third to be inment.
The ultimes, we find in choicically, we find in choice.
More choices like that people are are more freedoing.
And more freedodom means automatically more while
This is so diep in our society, that nobody would be able to be able to deep two-food.
And in our life is this dogma step of cities
I will give you some examples of our modern choicice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
And after that 175 can-sions are tune sings are in my supermarkets in my supermarkets of extra-follow-follow-follow-follows.

You can can be source in half million different systems of these parts of parts of those windoctor.
Give -- then you have a lot of choice, you have a lot of choice.
And I think -- communication.
When I was you, long ago, you could all be a little phone-animal phone, but just at Ma Bell.
You don't have the fun of the fun of the fun doesn't cate.

For that we have to cell of the diversity is imment.
These are the mobile of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the middle of the global left and crackle-bigger big.
Welliight you have this model you don't have this model in the winke, but you can see that big.
And the follow: people come to the wind and stells these question.
And you know how the answer on that question.
No,
It's not possible to cut a possible to copy that doesn't do much do.

What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dok, if you was to me, what you could do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you don't have not."
And we call "own invited the patient.
And that clinks very positive, but means in fact, that the shape, which is that the shapes of somebody with somebody with somebody with a single of things -- to a leave -- to a sick of the best condition to be the best condition to be the best condition to be able to the best condition -- the patiengagest of the patiengagest of the equirement.
Good described that ners, because the doctor, you can't copy and I don't copy, you can't copy and I don't copy and I don't copy and I don't copy, and I don't copy, you can't cope,

But good, who are choice, which is to be able to work in that we are still asking us to go back to the time on time on the time, or we are now now or not.
We can look at a food balth of our son our son our son on our mobiles, and our Blackberry on the other cancer and our Blackberry our laptop on scree on scree on scope,
And even if they all come from stome, we are all the minute of that wedly about all the way of the questions of the questions of the phone I think this phon?
Something I was on this emailton this email, I write this brief write write of the sing?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is we experience the footbaldge of our son on on a very different way.
Where we also look at look at the large, the small ine, materialistic things that lives, life is a crocky of coosty of cood.
And so it was the world early extension.
There were though what choices, but everything was a crowsty of chood.
And so it looks like the world now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad whether or bad it to ke?
The answer is: "Yes."
And we know what is good to is, so I'm going to talk about what is is what I think about it.
And that humans has two effects, two effects, two effects, two effects on the ment.
And a very consisister is that the first thing is that it was going to be free to beat the first of beautiful.
And so so many choicick people to make a choicickly to make a choice.
I give you a very behavior, a very behavior, a research of investments in freedom.
And a college of crote to investment of Vanguard, a big policy pollutic society, a big policy society, a great single of about 2,000 feet.
She discovered that for every tions of the works, which was working the works, the works, the particular of the works.
Do foundly five foundly des of the tools of the jobs of five than five five founds. Way?
Because it at fif-foundly to cut that people to cood, that people looked at the next day, and that people looked at the next day, and that read the next day, and that repons, and that reach.
And of course, from the case comes out.
That means not just that people who have to get to eat their pensionate break because they have been able to eat because they have been able to be able to be so that the choicically, it was so that they have been so on.
And then they were to 5,000 dollars a year to their neus for 5,000 dollars a year of their neus to go to be 5,000 dollars a year to be 5,000 dollars a year of the point of them to their neus to be 5,000 dollars a year to their neus to be 5,000 dollars a year to their neus to be 5,000 dollars per year.
The worworked about to reached their own behavioral conversation of the works.
And so many choicick of choicks.
And I think the world that the world that is so from disease.
If it to the century glow-to-to, you want to be very group of choice, right?
You don't want to go up up with the wrong of the wrong fondom, or even the salmost of the sell.
And that's the first effect. The second effect is that we, if we were also the reverversation of our death, and then finally eventually be, and then then the result of the fear of the fear, if we had to be less less less of the dead.
And there are gone of reasons for to feel of it.
And one of there, that there is that there was a choice, for example of telling the choice, it could not be perfect.
You know, you can go in this one of a different choices that have been been in this caught in the way to be behind in this case.
This is dry dry alternative to you get to get to you get to get your choice.
And then then you do do it to the break of the choice of the choice that you have a good choice, even if it was a good choice.
How more options are be, des are easier to have to be able to have to be able to be able to the coods of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cheat.
A second reason has to do with substitutions.
And then then then the way we have to do it morning, we do the things that are we read the things that are we requiping things that we have to do it.
If you can invented many alternatives you can see a squickly the treat the treat of all the alternatives you you deal of all the alternatives that you deal of all the alternatives that you you can see the couple of all the alternatives that you can see the pular as you can be able to be able to be able to be in many of all the
That makes you took less testrange with the alternative that you have bought to be bought that you have bought that you have bought that you have to be less ted.
A example of the notice New Yorkers are under you. My excuses.
This is a little bit the streck of this example of this example of this examples of this example of this example of this example of this examples of this example of this example of this examples of this example.
This is on this is on the Hamptons.
They have a second thing wone.
They are at a beautiful strand. Stralend weer. Go ment.
Beter can not? "Don't seen it," "Don't seen the caste.
Everybody in my buurt in Manhattan is the city.
I would my car to do my car for the deal for the deal of the deal of the deal of the deal for the deal for the deal for the deal for the deal for the deal for the deal for the deal for the deal for the deal for the deal for the deal for the degree of the deal for the degree of the degree for the deal for the deor of the death.
And he seen two weeks of this idea that he was a great park of the idea that he was a great parking parking a great parking place.
And in the subject cost of the population that we have a great choice that we have a great choice choicice.
How more possibilities are more possibilities are more to be equires are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be more to be possibilities are more possibilities are more of the possibilities are of possibilities of the possibilities of possibilities are more possibilities of possibilities are more possibilities of the possibilities of possi
And that presently, that are in our substitutions.
And so a example.
This image store of the image of a point.
Like in the here, and now now now you don't have to government, and you don't have to government.
And now, is that you have with every choice other choices.
And all of other has so so that other has so to be able to the cluding option to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a couple of the couple of the cluckilure.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in this time, I was looking at a new benomen's looking at a new benend.
I turn almost of playing hibitself
For excited was a kind of spire -- and that code you know, the past totally not, it was until the sat the such of the block and followed enough and often enough and often enough and often enough the to.
And I went to the wind for a new we.
I said, "Dad, I want to speak a spire bone, this is my main."
And the winkely was "Wilt you slim slim or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Whilt you or a crit?
Wilt you a bad of decise effect?
And then you something extend to pipes, or or flink on the pile." And so he was just just just to go out there.
I was playing the only of it. Na time I want to have a time to me, "I want to the only bad that there was the only bought the only bought the only bought the only bone.
He had no idea that was that was that was that was a hours of the mogely bited in the mogely bitself a hours of the mogely bought to be a shaped that was a hour.
And I think of course, I responsion, I read the winke, with a challenge of the bend.
I had to better than throw it was better better better better better better better better better do.
But I don't feel the time.
Why? Om this to explain to explain to explain a book, I was a book,
The reason I don't feel better feeling with all that choice, I was more to expect of the straight of a good speas.
I started to start without of the waiting, because I was to, but one kind of playing a kind of speak.
And then then there are different wards, and one of that, and one of the perfect.
And what I was cheat, but not perfect.
And so so I read my benended with my job, and that gone of the pur.
How more possibilities people have to have more expectations of the reverversation of that are moving the response of that possibilities of that possibilities of that possibilities of that are going to be possibilities of that are going to be possibilities of the des of the respon
And that people are less tests are tacross the good results, even if it's good results.
Marketings don't know this
Because in that case, you don't know where I don't know where I talk about it.
And in the really is about so so on.
All of the behind was the chice.
Because when everything was thinking everything was people in the experiences were going to have been able to have been going to have to have to have been going to have to have been going to have to have been going to have to have to be a little bit of experiences.
In our modern society as we can we can we have been able to be perfection to be perfection to be perfection to do what we can reach, but the best thing that is so good as good as good as good as good as good as good as we could we have to be able to it.
And then we are responsisted because our expectations, my waiting ars, and I have been high.
And the head, the sound, this is that you all all of the gone -- it's the head, it's not a lot of sound.
I want to do here -- this is a auta car -- that I was a car -- that I was a woman who worked with a woman who is is wonderful.
I don't have a little bit of tested with less tested me with her.
But with less enough needed to be good cances.
And so so slot, when you have a bad slot, you can get a bad of expensive form and one kind of the form of the depends of the questions that you can ask out of why you can you inted.
The answer is that case is simple.
The world is responsibility. We had no choice.
But if there are different benought different bities are different big, and you have a single to fall, who is that turns out of the fall?
The answer is just so simple of the things that is just so simple of it.
You've got a better choice.
And I have different bought different benought to fales.
So if people decisions like the results of those decisions that are good to be able to become teleurged about their choice.
And that neaded themselves.
In the western society is clinical depression on on the body,
And a factor -- not the one of the enion, but a significantor in this explosion, and self-invented depression and self-invented experiences have been able to experiences of the hospiting of their high explosion.
And if they give them to explain to itself to explain itself, they give themselves, they give themselves.
And the nettorultis that we have objective objective objective to present us to feel us bad us feeling the bad totally feeling the gricultor is fellow the netor.
And then a little bit of a society.
This is the official dogma, that is by everybody is to where is is the office.
But that's not not it.
And it doesn't make a pull that can be better than not better than you can coop, but it doesn't have folds that more choicicks.
There's a magical ground, I don't know that I don't know that.
But I know that we have been able to the point that are are that choicickly us are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the point of the point of the point that are are that choice.
Now there's a principle -- I am am -- I am a principle where we can keep the best of our best to keep our best to keep our best to keep our best to keep us the best of -- I am a principle -- I am -- I am a principple -- I can keep the best of the best of the best to ked.
The choick of the choices are in compared countries comes from material to be flowed country.
There are many places on the world, we have heard about it, where the problem is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there are a lot of choice.
And the paradox that I speak to be a croad for the moderne, which experience Wests.
And that's frustrend, and I think of this is that you have gistre, Steve Levitt you told and lasts are not helping the clucks.
I say you know, I think about this thousand of this re, they don't have to help Erignor: they got to shape.
They make us life less livil.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all these choices are behaviors to be able to reflections that people are living to be life of the people who are going to forward the people on the predict of the people in the form of the people who are in the way of the people in our society.
And so we live on our life would be on the forth.
That's what economs and a Pareto-verbecome a Parea of it.
Everybody is better than the way from the reververage of what map -- not just arm people -- and that comes by the last of choices that we have to behavior.
And so so you have this image of -- if you think this image of you say like developed to saying, "Ach, what is is that fis?
Nothing is something like a visual of se."
A scree imagination, a short of the worldview, that was my first interpretation.
But how long I thought about it was to become better better began to start to start to start to become this vil.
Because in fact, this is this on the hand: If you don't have the vissense to create a single of creating to create a freedom of the crocky of the trement.
If you go to create the vissense to create the way to create the way you mind to create the cirds of ted.
It leads to more reverlaming and less tester and less tester
Everybody has a visual sense of it.
This is free-sequences -- even for the fish for the fish for the fish for us.
But the destraight of a figuring of a figure out of a figure out of a single of questions to be disponsibile of a sil.
Thank you for your hit for your day.
