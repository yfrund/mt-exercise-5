And I just showed these two dia's slide to show that the Poice ice ice ice of the United States, who had about the last three million years of the United Statand 40 percent of the United States,
But this is actually the nice of this particular problem because it doesn't the disservice.
The ice skin on the North Pole is in a sense, in the clopping heart of our global climath system.
It's just in the winter and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the side.
The next slide that I shows is a version of what the last 25 years is happening about 25 years is happening 25 years of happening in the last 25 years is happening to be happened to the next 25 years is happening version of what the last 25 years is happening to the last 25 years is happening the last 25 years is happening to be the last 25 years is happening that I showing you is a version of what the last 2
And the permanently apply in the rood.
As you see, she's going to be blue.
That's the year, it's the year, in the wish ice ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer side.
And the so-called permanent, five years or older older or parent, that's almost like blood, that from the body sicks.
And in 25 years is the way from this is going to this in this is going to this in 25 years --
And that's a problem because the frozen was born around the North Ices, and there are a very big amount of flowing woman is very big amount of carbon is becoming a very big amicrobes are consider microbes in methane,
And the consider of the total amount of the atmospher, that could be exploring that could be exploring the amount of the engaged point to write the engaged.
In some indeepe deepe murbs in Alaska borrely methant to all of the water.
And then the last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another ondiep dieputom.
Why! It's OK. The question is the question or we will be that will be going to be that will be going to be able to be that.
A reason for that, this is that these huge called warmbron" Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of warming
This is a smell twatriver.
The waterer-volume is the water-volume is greater than own.
This is the Kangerlussian reverer in South west-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea single style because it's agricultural is the place where the sea place where the sea place where the sea --
These stroming these are takes are taking on the flu.
And the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the South Pole, the largest of mass mass mass mass on Earth.
And they were rapported rapped scientists that the continent now, a negative ice balance balance balance --
More specifically is the ice in the west.
The whole continent to six meter seespiece of six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the one of two after two after masmass, there are new notics, which is a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of his drinkwater from that meltiply.
In the Anths, this glestjer the sources of drinkwater for this city.
There's more stroys.
But when they disappearing the drinkwater.
In California was a very, a very, about 40 percent in the Sierra.
It's coming in in the waterrors.
And as you could read the predictions are going to be nstigins.
This global dreaming dreaming to a dramatic stipped to a dramatic stipes.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with a incredible and never several and never separate facty.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the last 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping unkeeping it.
If you look at the botttook from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 across CO2 a..S.
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, look at the eye area of the Stillet's look at the Stilleft, from America, and every single sil, there is a behavior, there is a behavior in the ocean in the ocean in the oceans.
The only big causes of the Earth, the only of the Earth, in the earth, which is for 20 percent of the world's branches of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fuel --
Olie is a problem, and steenkool is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding the China.
And there was a form of building a lot more city-carbon centrales.
But we see a commeasure.
These are the city-carbon centrales where the bbecame annuated in the last years, and where green alternatives,
There's a political streeding on the gang in our country.
The city-carbon -- and ololie-industry gave years, from the beautiful years, from the beautiful stixtomately,
And that image in something about something about something that I think.
And Round the church, at me home in Tennessea, about four billion literally bulch model.
You probably have seen it in the news news in the news
This is the one after one after one after a largest dislide in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cookoom around the Kerstood was death,
Video: """Frosty the city-carbon man is a stage, a stage, a key cally.
He's fluence here in America, and he's going to be in America, and he cares in America, and he cares growth.
Frosty the city's coolman is becoming the day with the day becomes the day
He's paid and scattle, and they're working."
Here is a big part of the city-cool in West Virginia of day.
The largest minister of the country is the big bad of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwheship -- "Let me be clear Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Real, they don't know where they talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimating protection two campaigns on your too.
This is a piece of a little bit of it.
And Video "Bue COL, we see the climate change, as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why the reason is why the most important goal is to give us a gigantic behavior, and the rest of the light of the light of the truth of the truth of city.
Feit is, stead, not smart.
We find that the shoot is -- and it still seems a little bit more liked.
So, you don't make a climate change.
Let me just show us about it.
Video: Acteur: Schone steengino: Schone of them is a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern cool centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are making very very well as a little bit of lay --
But that's the sound of shone cooly.
And then, the fact that the breakes of stepping cool one of the most important war of the Earth is changing the remarkable to be the remarkable to be able to see here.
Look a look at the beautiful cooly of today.
Al Gore: Einally past the positive alternative alternative alternative alternational security.
Video: Stem: America saling in crisis, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red rate is the rock is our dependence of fossil fuel of fuel like vile collapsed and and imported oile collalapsed oile coly.
But now there's a form new solution to get out of this.
Forth America of 100 percent of sculple electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get the America to work on the work on the work and a plan that makes us and the opposite of the Earth regard.
And finally, a solution that are enough to solve our problems to solve our problems.
Repower America. Our tangle.
Al Gore: And the last though one.
Video: Stem: It's about the America to give America is re-involving energy.
One of the fastest ways to make a final endone to our dependence of old fuel that our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: No we investments to create good paid paid good paid paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African old African old African old African old African's going to be now.
If you want to go far about.
We need to go far far and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I was a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I refed to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So I am notice. For those who don't waren: the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever entrees, 27 kilometers in the enomb.
It has to be the circle nabope that were less than a billides that were less than a billides after the universe was started to 600 million times a second million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, dus!
This is the machine under Geney.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors -- this is the ATLAS. ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the attacular --
And at 10 seeptember about the machine for the first time we put the machine for the first time.
This picture picture was called ATLAS.
And that worried for a partment in the controlllam.
It's a picture of the first particle that all around the first particle that all around the way around the LHC ging, and with a piece of the LHC, which is the bad in the detector in the detector in the detector in the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September 1September that works, what a huge consider is a huge consider to be a huge consider to the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this the largest across the biggest across and saw that the Internet pages that the Internet pages so out the Internet pages so out the Internet pages so out of the sliked.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact impact impact as a scientific impact that we made a cultural impact that we have a cultural impact as a cultural impact as a cultural impact as a cultural impact as a kind of impact that we have a cultural impact a cultural impact
And a week later, we had a problem with the machine, what had with these golden behaviors.
And they were 13 thousand of circle couple of cross-powered entire power.
The engineers will say, "Not true true you'll be small behavior."
They can do that because they're superago, and they can idend his very lower temperatures.
So on min 271 grads, colder than the space between stars, that can be behaviors that behavior.
In one of the connections between the neine between nine in the LHC, was a constructive constructive folt.
And it was a weird thing that was a wirmer incentive to be electrical weather,
This was the result.
This is still inpressing if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of the 20 tons of the magnets were about 30 centimeters.
We had about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out out of it, what we did we do.
We all were eparated and the follow.
Now they're back on the way.
Eind mist, the LHC will be intact.
We're going to put it back and we expect it and we expect it in juni or right so we can go to expect what the building building the building of the universe.
Now, of course, have the insounces the debate of scientific research of scientific research research of scientific research of scientific research of the value of the value of scientific researd.
I think it's a little bit that it's so hard is that the fact that we go further than the LHC.
I let the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I think, in the deaths of the value experiments of the value experiments of his teachers' Farael Farael Faral Faral Faravy, "Nthing that we are that our images of our images that we don't have a images of the world-inventing our images are not a new mysterions in the nature,
Thank you.
I would like to start with you start to ask you back to your childhood at your childhood at your childhood --
And when you discover the way to gray it, they were just going to be able to learn and the consciousness and the hand, you know, the engineering and hanging across space relations.
Ruilia, you know, insight, because with the understanding of the world to us.
If a information of information and inspired by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with objects and my medical workerker, I started to ask me -- what we could -- what if we could use a computer that engine computer that would be a computer that engineering enter-basically reauthority that would be a kind of the engineering and we can actually be a platlay with the information and the following information that we can frow with the information with with with the the the the other other thing that we can can inspide information in the way to information and information and information of information of the way to be conconconconconconconconconconconconconconconstststant information with the cluence with the best best thing that that that
and ordering order, as we wante?
And these question, we decided to figure out a answer to find an answer to find a single of Siftables.
Cort collaborate is a Siftable computer is a cookjake of a cooks.
They can be moved, they can feel together together, their movement detect and they are contained a screen and they put a screen contact.
The nuclear access, the physical handely, just like blocks like blocks can be put on the graph of graph --
And the ventually angry example of a new example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that this helping tools have a more physical differentling their movement and each other, and even from each other, and even from the way we move them motions, there are different new and interactons of interactions.
I will start with some simple examples.
And this Siftable is instituated a video tunate, which is playing by changing the way and otherset playful and otherset playful --
These interactive portraits of each other.
And Indians have put together together, they're interested in each other.
And if they become rings and they can also be single single and become some nervous.
And they feel they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaw that one of the interesting consequences of these interactive, the use of interesting in the interactive, as it excise of a color as it was a fluence of a color as it was a fluence of a color as it was a fluences of the interactive,
In this example are three Siftables left up and I can use them to go color in a very very small in a lotables where they become humans and they become humans
And if we went back to the threw back what we went back.
There are some crich, there are some of the education of the education, mathematics with language, mathematics and the result of people where we want to give the possibility and the result untelling things that we want to see the result immediately,
So here I show -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci series by a simple calculate programmmate.
Here we show a game that a cruise between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the Siftable, and the sense of every Siftable, and I have controllled in a wordbook.
And after about 30 seconds is the very rescue, and a different records of a little bits of possibilities of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I'm in the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to make it and make a video of it.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of these apply is that people almost not instructions need.
And all the thing you have to say "Most word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the tests.
That's our young best battack-tester, righright?
And it looks like he was just the Siftables.
And for him this was just blocks.
Here is a interactive painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for the language of language
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new carakters in the scene, by just the Sifable with that cookaracters of the table.
Here he leave the sun up.
Video: The son comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene area.
Video: The orange tractor.
God. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And by the shapes of Siftables and the nice together places and the nice and make the carakters with each other, Waf!
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open fine.
and he decided how it pushed.
Video: The cat air.
DM: The last example that I will show show that I will show you a synthesizer and live music that we developed recent a sound product that we developed recent a sound product like the lead, basic and pressure pressure and pressure pressure and pressure pressure and presses.
Eengineer, in fact, where you can choose what you want.
And these sound in the age of Siftables are injected so that you can participate the pattern itself in the pattern itself.
And you put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the same of a lege Siftable effects like reverb effects like reverb and filter.
They are going to a sound across and apply across the chances by changing the sound
And every general effects like tempo and volume and volume that are access on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern to a first pattern, to a first pattern.
Now, I put the basline here.
Video: DM: I'm going to add some beat.
Video: DM: And now I copy the print, so I can influence the effect lives.
Video: I can get it very quickly, very quick by the chances of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I copy the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can rescue the pattern of the pattern as it playful.
So I don't have to plann, but I can improvision, but I can improvision, it very longer and shorter as I want.
And finally, finally the dimmse of the gevery, by the volume Siftable to the left Siftable to the left Siftable to the left Siftable to the slion.
Thank you.
And as you can see, my passion from the passion of new peop-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brain and working on the way our brain works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design, in this design, and some possibilities that we developed in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this only is that this only is the atsize of hell hell in the interacting with digital media that information in our world as we want.
I thank you from harte.
I look at them out to talk to you with you all and talk to you with you all the time.
I'm write.
And the thing about is my work, but also so much more than that.
And my whole life is a long life and I finding write and I don't think that that ever changes.
But there is unfortune something happened in my life and carrier and carrier and carrier and carrier with my work with my work on my work to my work on my work to see my work on my work on my work and career,
It started with a book that I was regs a memoire: "Extom, Biddly, "Extom, that very in the early work all the world about my first work the world about the international exister and an international existencible exister and an international existence.
And the population is that people have to go and always told me and always told me and always doing.
And so that -- I do do that!
People come to me and questions come to me and questions "Do you never care you going to evenar?
Don't you afraid you will be writing your whole life is going to be a book that people will be a book that people will be going to let out of the things that people will let you have to be a book you will be going to be a book you will be going to be a book are going to be a book that people will be going to be a book you will be a book you will
Don't you afraid there.
And the touch, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very very remember 20 years ago, I was remember 20 years ago, when I was a teener -- when I told was a teener --
People said, "Do you don't get succes?
Do you don't afraid for education, that you will be able to supposed to be on the enably?
You don't afraid you you live in this work is going to be something that there is ever something out that there is ever going to be something out on the puin of your buildings with your fail, you know, bitter-bitter-nature bitter-ness of falis?"
Itin that streting.
And in the short comes to this questions on this noise is on this noise is going to be on this novely on this notice is going to be on this notice is going to be on this notic.
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are enough that are enough things.
Also, all of the time.
But I also really really a lot of other things band, you don't know what it was all all of the time.
For sea for example, and other engineer, and other engineers.
But what was writing write to the last time when you go to the last time that are coming frow today.
Is it ration?
Is it enough someone eight is an eight is the work for the work for the work for their mention?
And what's really really really really about creative processes that we make us to the effects of the mind-stese, something something that is something about the other species of work at the other species of work at the other species work.
And I take my father. He was shop, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that there in the 40 years that he was ever someone in the 40 years or he was not afraid or he was not afraid to him that there was not afraid anyone in the 40 years that there was not afraise.
And so from "Yohn, how is it with your chemistrunning block?"
No, no, so there was not about it.
And to be fair -- screeded engineers have been taking honor not the reputation of the century crazy for stustudy mber,
Presistance, who have some kind of reputation.
Not only writer, other creative people have been instable, the reputation of human beings beautifully instable.
And look at the grim of the dead deading in the 20th of creative minists of the 20th century.
And they are felt young by own acking.
And even those who don't even the engineers are no longer places to be able to be able to be their gave in their gave place.
In the last interview for his dead said, "Meteting, "Mit: "Metetcy is a piece of mititself --
That's a pretty thing to say about your life work.
But from this kind of exciting this kind of excells.
We all have heard it all earlier and have it all accepted.
The heavy thought is that creativity is that creativity is unlost of the list of list and that a artistic existing will leave to accelerate to accelerate to act.
And so I want to ask everyone here today you with that ide?
Do you do that?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I don't think about it all a little bit of thought.
I think it's the weather sweking.
And also even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century, I would just like this century,
We can creative gests a lot better than a lot better than it.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be to live in that dark in the dark of dark in the dark of the dark of the dark of me, in my situation,
Seker is the fase where my career is now now in the career now.
Go tune, I'm still young a vetimate year.
I can also be four decades.
And the Hoostray will be seen all the way that I now now now are the outside of the outside of the outside of that outside,
And we're here with friends under the gale, so I can clapping you very much as it is probably the most success is behind me.
Yemig, what a idea!
And if you think about it, you know, I'm going to know the morning to the morning neure.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me of love with the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love in the work that I love love me of the work that I love love in the work that I love love me of the work I love in the work I love love me of the work I love love
And the question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I can just come to the conclusion that I can just go to write a psychological protection in the process involved in the process iness.
I have to see the write a securt of create distance between mistake and my survival angst for the reactions, and my future publications.
I was just just just a few years to do that.
I am in the history of the history and have me deept in other civilizations to see or others to see or others a better way to help people to help people to help people to help to help people to help the emotional complications of the creative process.
And my search ch has been born in the old Green and Roman and Roman and Romond-end.
Let me up, because it's a long and complicated.
And in the time of the old Greeks and Romends don't believe that creativity was going to be that creativity was from themselves.
And I believed that creativity was a godable place, that was a godable place, that came to the human beings accountable place.
The Greeks called this craised involved in creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demon that he had a demon that words influistered him --
The Romends have a species of the Romave idea.
And if you put them on them a consider creative mind creative minds.
And the grappy is that the Rombs with a geniy person a genion.
In their policy was a genion, a genius of a magical godable in the murs of the ateler of the ateler of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the huiselve.
If the artistic was the artistic -- the artistic ention.
And he gave it form on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the first thing I talked about the first of had, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work works.
The artistic was so in protection called called called called called ""much narcism.
If you were brilliant working you was not all the eat.
Everybody knew that was a unvisible geniy genion,
And you know, you got worked you -- you know, you couldn't just do you know,
Everybody knew you knew you a pretty rather independent.
Lange time that was the mind of how in the West creativity was described
And when the Renaissance, and everything changed.
And there was a very new idea: the individual human beings is the average of the universe and engineers.
No space for mystical weather, and it's stuff from the god-didly.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity is completely from the individual from the individual --
And for the first time in history, there was artiststs that they were a genion, and they were a genion, and not that they had a genion.
I think I have to say that I think I think a big found.
And to one person, one one single individual individual is that he or she saw the securrent is the source of the century mystery, of the century of everything whatever godling -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something that is a much for a fragile for a fraile of fragile for a fragiile of fragiile human being,
And if you ask someone asks the sun in the sun sun.
Egos are read to gigantic proportic proportions and there are unfortunately, expectancy of prestations are resists.
And I think this pressure has been made the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists in the last 500 years of artists in the last 500 years of artists has been made the last 500 years of artists of artists.
If that's so so that is, and I think is the question: "What do is the questions?"
Can we do this?
And we go back to a old understanding of the relationship between human relationship between human and creative mysterii?
Maybe not.
And we can do 500 years we can be rational humanism not unfortune in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes speech.
And probably the scientific people who are reduced scientific people who are refels about the idea that else entire degree and some parts with some partments with some partments to inspiring high-high-tes.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you in there,
And yet, I ask it out.
Why noisn't it?
Why would we have thought not thought that day?
And it fasts just so much as much as all the other explanations of the totally calculate uncalculate that are decisions in the creative process.
Everybody who are trying to create something -- so in fact, all the attastes here -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to be rational process --
And it is a paranormistakes are in paranorms.
I have been dealthy the great American closer Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of the United States.
And so, it's closer to the ngentiy. Her whole life all write they close to close close to close close to close to close to close to close to be closing.
And she told me about her youth on the platand of Virginia.
Some -- if she was on the following was a pulled so, they get a close to be a closer to the country.
It was so she said, as if there was a big wave air.
And so, a close wave than the country to her across the country to her across the country to her across the country to her across the country to her across the country to her accountry to her across
And she felt the flows of her feet, and they were able to do that her at that point and do that at the time to do once for her life.
And they running into home, backwards by the getting close and they had to see the close and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and they were just going to see the closer and they had to see the closer and they were seen the close and they were just going to see the paper and ppearing it to
And when it was closed by her hunt was that her only chances her only chances to write it on the only chances to write it on the only chances her only chances her only off.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
And then then it doesn't get the house but calculate the house not.
And in the point of these moments the close by her him, in fact, and so, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another so.
And I think there were a thing, I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost animals.
And then she was looking for them in house and paper, and paper, and it became close by her him and paper,
You'd have been going to get a potately,
And with her other hand, so she told me me me so, they were the close to the close to the close to the close to the close to the close to the close to me and then I was the getting me close to me, and they told me me and so,
And she paved it close to his state, and it back in her body while she wrote it back in her body while she wrote it.
And in those cases, it was the close that was very close to paper in the sense of paper, but then in the entirely follow.
And when I thought I think -- what I think -- what accident my creative proces!
And so my creative process. I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouse of mouth, which is a mouse of the same time stiping and transformed and transformed and transformed it.
But even in that daily swood, I had a experience about experience.
You also know it is a little bit of the feeling that there is a source that there are creative ideas in your impossible to identifying impossible to identify impossible to identify.
What is that fun for fuon?
How can we use it without that we are worth?
And in a way that we are good for us to do that?
The best contemporaine example that I can think about this is musiciance Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a while, I was a magazzzerero.
We had it.
And in fact, a big part of his life life is the shows of his life is the shows of the consider of the power of the power is trying to get out of all the power of the unconcerned creative impulsable creative impulsulsable impulsil.
And in the 190s, Tom what rustiger.
And one day he was in Los Angeles of Angeles about the fastster radical.
And as he was so he heard a fragment, he heard a fragment.
The decision, as inspiration that does across the death, degrap, crope, calculate
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to fashthes.
But it doesn't do that.
He didn't have no paper -- no paper to a tancy in the time.
The well-consider exciting the bottom, "I got the melody and then keep it seems me behind the century.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it enough, I can't it."
He didn't get in panic, but he didn't stop that all mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and he looked at the air, you can't see that I sat the air, you can't see that I sat the stud?"
"Do you really really write that I can write a song of song the song of the song of the song of the things that I can really write that I can really write a song of the song of this?
If you really want to do that this love is going to be later later, you know, when I have time for you have.
And not going to do anyone else are fall.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen's going to be lose the process very other.
And the work is the same thing with the best excellent in the dark subject.
But the sware spanning that creative process in him region the genion, when he distroy distroyed of genion.
The gene size it was going to be on the house and levered only the skin.
And then then then you know, there was no reason to go to the engaged by going to go to the engaged.
It could also be a wonderful bizarre conversation between Tom and the own, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own,
And that's what I worked work.
I haven't even profit of it.
I was in the middle of E, Biddle -- Biddom.
And at a point moment I love in want.
You know that you want to work but not good and you think it is a terrible ramp of the worst book. The book ook ook up.
Not just just so-bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad it.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that are genius who are genion, and I decided to be a posed way.
I wished from my manuscrips and I was going to a very very much of the room of the room of the room.
And I said hardopy: "Lister thing, we know that if this book not just brilliant -- not only by me.
You can see that I think I have everything in what I have.
I don't give you a couple I can't feel it.
If you find that it better than you think it's better you've got to do it.
You know, Do you don't do that? Do you don't you.
I just write because that's a little bit of my work.
Oh, and in the notuls are just a lot of changgard, you know, a differently.
Tja--- Uital comes in this notice here.
Eeuwen ago, there were in the North African woostine people together to maillid maththing,
And the Uren and hours, to the morning gores.
And that was always wonderful, because the dancers were fullled professionals.
But sometimes, some of the hundred something besides.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know, you know about that I mean, you know, you ever ever seen something that you have seen something that in performer.
It was as if the time was stilized and the dance of a poor.
He didn't did nothing else than the thousands of nights nights and nothing together, but now everything together.
And then he couldn't just a human, and it just a human.
In him, under him blowing him him is glous.
A godly four fuses through the godnment him.
And if something called the thing happened to be happened to clap them what was Dan they started clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."
Because that was it was for them.
And by the way, a fun of historic, when the Mors South Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu South Spange:
The extincite is the chter by the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah."
And you know, you have the day at today in the flaments and flaments and flaments and flament.
If a artists in Spanish something unmoques or magically, it roeps -- human, ooil -- all of the way -- all of the one."
Our understanding, a glimp of God.
And then the recipment we need.
Lasty is the dancer that the next morning the next morning to the morning in dinsday, and he was 11 hours in the morning 11 hours don't have god-hours don't have god-hours in the morning is more god-hour.
And at that point is a little bit of ancestor, no longer man with lots of the well-such high-highlight will never come to be able to be able to be more to be until to be a little bit of the parent.
Maybe there will never be someone God never across the time.
What do he now he now do is what he now is life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell a creative mind to a creative mind.
But so it doesn't have to be not to be to be to be to be to be to be to be so pine.
And imagine you don't come out of your person that the most unusues of your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your your person from your your person from your your person your person of your person of your person of your your person the yourself is that the most un
And imagine that you believe that you have a time to be a while, not after a time to specificate them from a single fu.
And when you ready with it, they're going to someone else on someone else of someone else.
And so, it was all the way to be everything.
I put incentive that dad days that dad in the average of invent.
And the last months I worked on a book that will be able to be differently. And the book where a long time to be looked at a long time to be looked at the same time.
The operating consider of that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me with me the hall, I love me of the same an: You don't know the same and, you don't have any consider it.
Doe just you work.
And just you do thing, what it is.
And if you are joy your job is going to thank you.
If the god-geny genile, the god-decisions in your work at at some time of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful sources --
And it doesn't explain it, thank you all the time.
And then, "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that I belief --
"Oly!" "How do we just from pure human love and propertily human love and propertissue by stainability to be ploom."
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ollen!
You know, I just have it been about some of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it can mean and what it mean
And we actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology on the digitizing of digitizing that digital code to a new physics, and now we go from that digital in the biology and synthetisions of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions to ask the big question.
"What's life?" is something that I think about a lot of biolo-levels have tried to understand in different levels of levels are trying to understand in different levels.
We tried to do different approach, it back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years of the digitize of the digitize of the digitize of the digitize
And when we have the human genome we have sequence, it from the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we are trying to ask life to animate regenerate regenerate and create new life from this digital univers?
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the kind of a kind of that can conmentally conmentally consider in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at or we can come to a nine or we can come to a nature called genome.
We can get in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical cards, which is relatively compared with the unside.
Geloof me, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes that we can look at a piece of shaking, it's very unliving cell that would be a living cell cell.
And we decided that the only route forward to synthesis to synthesis so that we could deep the components to the components to be so the components to be a few of the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions to ask the only fundamental questions to ask the only fundamental questi
And so we started asking questions as we started asking a chromosh synthetisers?"
And Staat the chemistry it this very big molecules that we never seen before?
And if we do that, if we can do that, a chromosopm "restart?
A chromosh mosest is just a piece of chemistrate material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of the digitizing is across exponential evidence --
Our ability to write the genetic code lose of the genetic code of slow-side, but is a fun slowed the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code code the gen
And our final point would put it on this moment on a exponential curve.
We're going to start with 15 years ago.
There were some stage slip, and we are some city of bio-ethical ethical action,
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA very hard.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it more following you the more following it out.
So we had to make a new method for the tincluding these little pieces and the corrigate of all the following of all the fold.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria deate.
We designed the stuck pieces, the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part of the things we put a chemists chemists in the bacteria and the bacteria called called the genetic code and virtues, and virtually make virtually grid particles are making the genetic code in the bacteria --
The virtual particles were going to be when they came out of the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was unlongs in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they were wellelling that model but all about well.
They laughing more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software are engineering in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromoses.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes the cassettes --
to understand what the deeply components of a living cells are the living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that needs to be very accure.
And when we first first did this genome together, in 1995 was the standard precision one front of a 10,000 basepares.
And then then we found after resequencing the original sequence, if we had the original sequence, it was not in the way to started.
And our parts of the design is the design of stucks that 50 letters are long-long pieces of 50 letters to all the other stucks of 50 letters to build so that they can design in the other pieces that we need to design so that they can go together.
We design unique parts in the fact here.
Maybe you have some of the watermes.
Bediti: we have a vieral genetic code: A, C, Geetic code: A, Geggard.
Trios of those letters for ruwway 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple attace for every aminoxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write words, swriting the genetic code to be thought.
And in the ancestorial signs we just just just a lot of them.
Some of them were teleurged that there were no dies.
We have these study studying these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they put them and together.
And we started studying studying five to make pieces that are five to 7,000 letters long, and then you have some of 24,000 letters and you have some of 24,000 letter, to 72.
In every city sokad, we could crosson that stuck them so we could sequences them because we could create a process that very robuy robuying a process that will you see straight -- you can see the straight of these stucks.
We try to do the point of automatisishing the point of automaticians
So this looks like a basketbalfine.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- they don't grow so much more in E.
And it explains the most of modern tools of the modern biology.
And so we went to get to other mechanisms.
We had a mechanism that homolo-o-eno-recombination is uses by biology to response to response that can add pieces of sroom can feet them together.
Here is an example of it.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiodurans that three million radiation of radiation on can.
And you see that in the bottom, my chromosopm just just looks like this.
12 ot 24 hours later it was going to be the each other, precise the first time.
There are thousands of organizes that are.
These organisms can be drood.
They can live in a vacum.
I know absolutely absolutely life in space can be able to exist, a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is many of the is, there are many of it,
Here is a deeply microphantotowards the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually actually with these processes -- actually with the right design.
And it is a cartomatically conceive cartomatically conceives.
This is not an electron-microscope photo; this is a sorder microscope photograph.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the auication that we went out out out the author.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages pages only to the genetic code the genetic code --
So, how do we started, how do we start a chromosophi? How do we it?
And it's a virus is the clearly pretty easy.
And it's a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, like wis: you whose you whose you know the celkern and do another in, and that's what you know if you know if you know if it is what you know if it takaryard.
And in the bacterious species is the chromosh mosphere in the cell, but we have unlongs that we can see a full transplantation of a chromosh mosphere, and we can extend to another another another, and it can be activate to another other people.
We have a chromosh mospher, we have a microbbby-species.
These are about so far from each other, and they were about so muth,
We added some extra genes so we could take for this chromosophim.
We have the contemed with enzymes all the eggged all the eggged pieces.
It was quite sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be very much avanced -- and you can be able to be able to value -- the new chromosopm was in the cell.
We even thought he would come to come to swe'd come to be able to get the process what was going to develop the process what was going to be able to develop the process what would come to shape, but we were just going to be able to set the process what would come come out of the process what would come to be able to figure out what he would come to be a process what would come to come out to be a process what he would come to come to come to the process what to come to come to come out of the process.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We all discoveries that are all kinds of these are taking mosophim have been taken out of it, or a third thousands of them in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one species.
People that evolution are as a little bit of the biology is not a lot of biology is a lot of biology --
There are enzymes that restricti-enzymes that are actually called DNA destroyms that are actually DNA restrictive enzymes that are actually DNA restrictive enzymes that are actually enzymes that are actually enzymes that are actually enzymes that are actually enzymes that are actually enzyms that are actually enzymes that are restrictive
And it chromosome that was not eat.
The cell -- the chromosh mosphers --
It was expressing, and it recognize the other chromosom, and then we had been a strange material, and we were finally just the cell with the new chromosopm.
He was blue from the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in the law of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time dwell, all the carakists of the one species of the encountry and changed in the new software we build in the new software we stop in the cell software we stopped in the cell of the cell of the cell of the engineering in the cell software that we stop in the new software we stop in the celling species of the new software that we stopped in very short time in the new species of
All the changes, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code -- it was changed.
And this magine sounds like genomic, but we are in state, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamental things.
And I pay paid before, I paid paid that this is not a scale -- this is prevborborhurses on 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid paid that we almost almost a new version of Cambrane explosion, where there are are making there in scale new species of species that there are actually based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly clearly when you look at what it is.
We're going to inside of six-en-half to 9 billion people, killed the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context -- I'm born in 1946.
There are three people on this planetal
for each one of us that in 1946; within 1946; within 40 years.
We have a lot of food with the food of clean water, medicine, medicine, fuel for the six-half billion.
That's going to be able to do that for neine that for next.
We use five billion tons of college tons of follow.
That's 100 miloons of fath fat.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever, or whatever, then then it is going to be a huge challenge challenge extension.
And then of course, all those carbon dioxide of the strain the atmosphere.
And for all our worldwide discoveries we have a database of about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the designer components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is present there from the diversity that is present from the diversity that is present there from the diversity that is present there is present different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the electronicaindustry.
We're predictive by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've got techniques to do techniques to do something called combining "combin-called combin-called combin-genomics called combin-genomics.
We've now now now now the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day --
If you think about the construction of 20 million genes of genes or tries to do it or involving octon or medicine or medicine or medicine or medicine or medicine with a small team -- we can changing with a small team in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can selecter for life fatbary, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real designer design, so that we work, so you can really go to the gang and a new kind of thing on the computer can design.
We don't know what it will see is going to see out of the things that will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code from seetic code out of the genetic code of disease.
We focus on fourth generation fuel of fuel like this.
Our long-seen shapes are just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of the sugardens will come out of sugar, more and more and more and more and more and different kinds of different different kinds of butano.
But the only way we think that biology is big influence without the food price of food and the describes and the describbing with CO2 as if we start with CO2 as as we start with CO2 as we are adventing the first food that we are confood to be able to do that first suspect the first fourth generation and then about 18 months.
Sunlid and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries discovery. We have all kinds of other method.
This is a organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, in coaling temperaturate temperaturate temperaturate temperaturate temperates.
It makes methane of CO2 with the most of molecular waterstant as energy brone.
We're looking at the way we can take CO2 we can take CO2 and easy four pipes to be fabried, where that CO2 come backwards to brandst-stoom to be able to sturb.
So in a short time we think we are in the basal question, we are able to break out on the basal question: "What is life?"
We have been doing -- you know, the describes do the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do it in TED -- where you can't do it in TED --
A important energy source is going to be a major energy source of energy brother.
But we also work on the cooking of these workle to be fastly servaccines in the clucines of the tools of these working.
And this year there was the griculture, we always just just just the flows on the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change by the textily combined vaccines --
And here you see how the future can see the future is going to see the evolution tree is going to change the synthetic bacteria, and finally eukaryota.
We're still further dising people.
Our goal is certainly to survive a chance to survivive for a long enough to do that which is a chance to do that which is a chance to do that which is a chance to do that wealth is a chance to do that a chance to do that wealth is a chance to do that wealth is a chance enough to do that wealth is a
And what I want to show you if first to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to a new technology that we brought to about a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you can get local or on immense amount of immense data can work with immense data can work.
We look at the same time in the digital images and can be able to stay in the way to stay involved in -- and except the sorts and the sorts and the sorts to our wish and the sorts to our wish and the sorts to our wish and the sorts of the magic.
And it doesn't make it out how much information we look at the big collections or images.
Most of these are normal camera pictures, but this is a scan from the Library of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 meapix.
It doesn't matter anything out of the only thing that would be influence, the amount of a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, a very example of non-image data.
This is the graug house by Dickens. Every cold cold to a chapter piece.
And to prove that it is really textly, and not imagination, we can do something that is really texty, to show that this really textily is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit of a book of a book in a book in a issue book.
I wouldn't do it in the time.
This is a realistic, example. This is an example.
Every big image image image image --
This is really a place the place and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or cross a scale memore.
We also have something done with the corner of the Guardian
We have a nice advertising of high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we extra information -- and we have extra information of information --
If you want to see the abilities of this car, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make the constitutions of hands of hands from hands four dealing with the screen to do the screen to do it.
We hope that this is no pop-ups more means and other third flaw -- not even more than not anymore.
Of course, are agrandmoving a for the doctors are applying a technology like this, I will not spend here to spend up here is a time to spend on this field, even much more than a lot of the behavior.
These are all the weain the U.S.
And put on top of a image of the NASA
So let's look at something else else look.
This is now now now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer vision research by Noah Snavely, proventing the University of Washington,
and Rick Srare ci in Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's the possible possible by Seadragon.
And when we do, you can see this -- we see the images and the multi-resolution experiences and the multi-resolution experience.
The space shake of the images has been here is meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images together so that they are consider the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockes -- where they're genomomomes -- where they're genomombs of photographers, and all these things are the space images.
I don't know sure or there is another environments.
There are a lot of space teleggle.
I like to like to be one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked these summer, to the communicate of the environments -- to the consider is the reality of these environments in our website.
We had to do a lot of advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just seek Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in the t-shirts of people in the on-shirts and the campus and eque.
And each one of these orange chirs a image that are part of this model that model was a picture of this model --
And so these are all Flickr images, which are in this way.
And we can take at simple way way to nature it.
You know, I never thought I never thought I ever thought I ever would work in Microsoft would work in Microsoft --
It's overwheliness here is so device.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are going to be mirror reflexcameras, a big number of them together, a big number of them together, in this environment.
And I'll try to find some strange images and find the images of the images of the strange images.
There are so much more works by face and third the faces and thise.
And somewhere in this is even a series of pictures -- there are side.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that are churried as well-churposed by the program.
If we could, if we could, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can actually do things with the social environment. This uses the data from all collective geities of the entire collective geits, the Earth looks like everything that everything to each other.
All these pictures are consider and shapes a little bit more than the sonce of the party.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the Earth is going to be a model that from the Earth is going to be a model that from the art of the Earth.
And as a follow on Stephen Lawler work the United States.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use, and what the predicts are growing the people who are used to the people who are used to the people who are used to the people who are used to the people who are used to the people who are used to the people who are used to the present people who are used to the people who are used to the people who are used to the people who used to use it.
Their pictures are going to be able to see metap-data that someone else inved.
If someone would like to climit would like to climb and their names, and their names, and then my picture of the Notre Dame reach, and I can use it with all those data, and I can use as a access to the space, that metap-six -- and created from every photos, and creating a kind of cruism model, and created social experience.
And of course, the be-product product of this imments are virtually model of every interesting place, which is not only from the air pictures, which not only is from away-pictures, but also also from the collectively -- but also from the collectively photographer.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I started doing that what you can make that what your software possible, in the next years, all the images that are dealing all the images that can copy together by everyone in the world together in the world together in the world together?
BA: Yes. What this is really doing this is discovery.
It create, the create, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that basis of the data in the imaginations.
And that's going to be exciting when you think about the richchching the richchchching of semantic information that much of these images.
When you go to imagine search for images, you feel a search of the webpage pages on the webpage of information about what the images.
What if you copy that imagement is the imaged image?
And then the number of the number of the environmental connections and the amount of rich that comes out of there,
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicition.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some questions that I want to talk about some of the question that I have been a book in a book in a book in the book in the book in the couple of the questions that I want to have a book of the questions that I would have been a book of the question.
Maybe you can see paralls with information of information from other sources.
And I also try to explain some bands that you can care that you can care that you whatever.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be precis: the official dogma dogma of all the wester, incomalized together.
And that official dogma air dogma louse of our citizens on the highest levels on the highest level as much as possible to them as much as possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, a big good, a big part of the human exist.
And the way that are freedom to do is able to do a higher which is a higher which is a higher which is a higher without inmentally including a lot of more than any inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choicicically, we find in choice.
More choices holds in that people are more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more well.
This is so deep in our society, that nobody would not be able to deep two-two-fell in our society.
And in our life is doing this is dogma step four.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket -- a tool griculture.
Even about threatening thing.
And in the 175 size class are threatening thress markets are in my supermarkets in my supermarkets in my supermarkets in the super-en-classroom and twal-clicos have been able to be in the supermarket.
And you can make your tallow them to make your tallow them to make a case between 175 species for you.
So that's the bottom of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can see itself your stronger itself -- loud spreakers, cassettespeler, radio verstrong.
And in the one electronics you can choose you can choose from this touch of this attack.
You can do a six-en-half million different systems, with parts of those winds.
And so you have a lot of choice, you have a lot of choice.
You know, a different example -- communication.
And when I was young ago -- you could all be phone services, but only in Ma Bell.
You hurt it across it. You bought it.
And that had been survival that it never stuck up.
And that time is forever.
And in the way there are very much different across the whole thing about it.
And in the cell phones is the diversity imments.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-plaer, nusher and cryer and cracy and cracy and cracy and cracy and cryy-fun --
And you know, the model you haven't see, but you can see, but you can see, but you can see, you can see, you can see that happens.
And the population is, people come to the winke, and stells these question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile of buying that doesn't do a lot of does.
And in aspects of the life that are much more important than the attention of stuff, this explosive tiny of choices a fact.
And the health care -- it's in the United States, not even though that you go to the doctors that you have to do what you have to do you what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and you know, thank you or we can do to do But, or we can do But, or we can do But,
Another has this for, and after it.
By this for, and then what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what do you find it is the finds you find it?"
And the doctor, "Ahas this predicts -- and tundeles, and took this predicting, and tunately, and took this predicting.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was doing me, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you too."
And we call that "own inbringing the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the sware the sware of decisions of someone with resistance -- the doctors -- the doctor, someone who are seememempty diseask is not the best condition to take decision, and the definition, and the patients are getting much more recipatientery regular geneessentially much more more recip,
And the way that are described that ners, because the goal group, you can't buy them.
Why do do if we don't make them copy them to copy?
Because they think we think we think we are the next morning our doctors to ask that other mark genees-average genees-average genesi.
Our identity, yet a ingratch of our existing existing us to choices as you can see on this dia sease.
Our identities of our background.
We find ourselves, we just want to be -- so often we want.
Everybody morning, you have to be thinking about what person you want to be able to be what for person you want.
Let's talk about the house is the shape, the shape.
There's a time time that freet, everybody looks at the car from it was very quickly as possible to the way to kids as possible to kids as possible to kidney.
The only reality was the only reality was with why, not when you were doing what you next to do you this:
Now freedom, everything for it.
I just give you very much at particular intelligent students, which I have been done less huge work on the same work on the earlier work on the ear.
They don't have dommer or agreed in early early than in early time.
No, they have it pressure with choices --
"Sell I wouldn't trust it?
Or will I wait? Not first child or a career or a career or a career or a career or a career right?
These are all single questions.
And they go through to them with a answer and they don't have to have their housings and they don't get a good circle couple of cates.
And they're very important life question.
And then we come in work. Carl just just all of that technology us to work in every minute every minute every minute of everyday in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, there's one place, I love secret that I love the dot.
I don't walk that because I don't want to keep place.
But good, that huge choices in the work of work in that we are still going to ask us and then and then we go to time on times on times on times on times on times on times or we go, or not.
We can look at a footbalthwest of our sonce of our single side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Black-so.
And even if they're all out of the state, we are all the minute of those weth with all kinds of the question: "Sal I asked this phone, "Sal I think?
And I just like this issue response? Salther I write this brief writing this brief issue of the fun of the cross?"
And even if the answer is, we experience the fetbalwood balanswer of our soon on on a very different way.
And what we also look at the group, materialistic things, life is a clasty: life is a chair of choose of choose of choose of choose --
And so it looked at the world was early exciting.
There were some choices, but not everything was a choices of choices.
And so the world looks at the world looks at the world.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad well?
The answer is: "Yes."
And we all know what is good about is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad to it.
And that huge choices has two effects, two effects, two bees of the human beings.
A very consider to be a very effect is that the first thing is that the first works than the free of the confreedom.
And so many choices are several opportunities to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic, a very dramatic, a research to investment in free-planns.
A colleague of me got access to investment data from Vanguard, a big polling, a big polling, a big polar society.
They discovered that for every dealing the work-foundly awful far treate, the particular two percent dishead.
And in fifth foundses, at at least 10 percent of them are less worknex, at five founds. Why?
Because it's in fifth foundations so lasty to choose that people are just so lasty to the next day, and the choice as the next day, and that it looks at the next day, and so forth.
And from excellent comes out.
And it doesn't mean that people who don't have any though bread their job bread because they don't have enough money because they have not enough money to do that the choice as a little bit of the choice as a little bit of the choice of them have been working for them.
And they were going to be 5,000 dollars a year on their nose nose for 5,000 dollars a year on their nose.
The worked about, the worked to their own behavior,
And so much choices can be lost works.
And I think the world through that the world through that looks like this.
If it is to the century, if it is you want to be the right choice, right?
You don't want to be surprising up with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect that we had the lost of our dissecing and cooperiod and finally finally less testranged with the result than it would be less less we had had been having optished.
And there are medical reasons for intentially involved in the time.
One of them is that there is that there is a choice, for example, they seem to be the choice, it was not perfect.
You put you in a case for that another choice that a other choice better would be behind in a case for that a case for that another choice.
This is droom alternatively to be able to get your choice.
And then it was doing the break of the choice of the choice of choice, even if it was a good choice.
How more options are going to be more options to be saying unaway to have the ineasier to be election.
A second reason has to do with substitutions.
And then Gilbert gave morning about how often we dependent the value of things that we do with things with the things that we are consimilar to be right.
If you can indent, if you can intention, you can invent, you can see the attrtrace of all alternatives you deeply the alternatives you destroy the engineering you in the alternatives, you can intentend to be the couple of alternatives you invented many alternatives, you can invent.
And that makes you fewer task you with the alternatively that you have cost of cost that you have cost it.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you.
This is a little bit the streck of this example.
This is on faith in the Hamptons.
They have a throw two-wone.
They are a wonderful strand. Stralend on the face. It's a humans in facturing face.
You can't be nois? "Don't difficult that men "Desesessentially thinking.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city.
I could do my car, I could do my car, I could do my car,
And he's two weeks to two weeks with the idea that he looks like that he again, a great parking place.
And in fact, we are taking cost of the entire thing we have, even if we have a great choicice.
How more possibilities are more opportunities are alternatives.
And those presenteries are substitutions.
And another example.
This imagination is what happens is going to some points.
Like in the here, and now for example, and you don't have to survive things that you don't have to survive things that you don't have to survive.
And another point is that you with every choice other choices out.
And all of the other has been intruly to be separated option the getable to be retruly the separty.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to the time I was going to go to a new bouch of bouch in the time.
I turned out almost always speeched breet.
And the most excited was just one kind of stuff, and it was the pastintable, it was unbelieved, it was uncomfortable, but if you were the bought long, and often enough and often enough and often enough it to.
And after years I went to the winknew for a new new now.
I said, "Day, I want to talk a jumptouch a little bit of it.
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart fit, easy fit or relaxed a relaxed that?
Do you or a crits? Wilt you crits? Wilt you was the crit?
Do you have a bouch with decision.
And you know, you just something exploring pipes, or flink out of pipe." And so he was just going to be on it.
I was sprainal stuck of it. No time said I said, "I want to the only bought that there was asked there that was asked there that was asked it.
He didn't have no idea which was no idea which was that was a hours for a long long blows all the possible bities of blowing the engineering bought that was agreed in the hours of the engages.
And it is first of all, I love the winket finally explored with a exciting bit;
I had better thought. And I could do all those possibilities I could do better do it better than it better than it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Well, OK? Well, this? Well, I wrote a book -- I wrote a book
And the reason I don't feel better with all those choice, I started expect to be more expect of the speed of a good speechoice.
I started without only only expectancy because I just just just one kind of stuff.
And then then it turned out there there are different wars, and one of them would be perfect.
And what I was chood, but not perfect.
And so I reach my bouch with my bouch with my expectances me teleur.
How more possibilities people have been desolid more expectations about the diststate of that possibilities of that possibilities.
And that means are less testranged with results, even if the good results.
Marketings people know this isn't known it.
Because in that case you didn't know where I'm talking about it.
And in the really is about that.
And all the way was bad was bad was bad was bad was bad at the time.
Because when everything was bad was bad people could have been surprising experience.
In our modern society, we can we as a varieties of citizens, but the best thing we can ever reached as well as we ever could ever be something as well as we ever had been expecty.
And after ever we are surprising our expectany, my expectanction, toro highlight --
The secret of happiness -- this is the secret you all come -- the secret is not a much much of happiness.
I want to do this: a autbiographic elementally -- I was a woman who really fantastic election.
I didn't have a little bit with less tested her with less tested with less testing.
But with less enough needs are needs his good changes are good cants.
And finally, when you coople the bad enduring a bad set as there is a bad single kind of present -- you can ask why you are intesting.
The answer is in that case simple --
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of hundreds of these are available to fall, who is it turns out to fall, who is responsible?
The answer is just so simple -- that's the you.
You had a better choices can make a better choice.
And with hundreds of different bouch of hundreds of fales.
So if people decided to take decisions, even if the results of those decisions are good about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the western society, four clinical depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive increasing of depression and itself, is that people are so often teleuring experience in the factor of their high-expectancission,
And when they try to explain the teleurposed to explain themselves, they do itself.
So the nettorial is that we put objectively objectively and feeling us bad and feeling us bad in the bad in electricks.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be able to get to where everybody is going to be able to be enomen.
But that's not not it.
And it doesn't make a two-foot that can be better than not a couple of them is not cartomatically that more choicice,
There's a magic floor of choicic, I don't know.
But I know that we are a long time before we are a long time that choicicy our separate of what is going to be able to be very well for a long time.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost finished -- a principle where we can keep the best thing to keep the best thing to do we can keep the best thing to do we can keep the best thing to do we can keep our best thing to do we hold.
The choices are industrialized countries come out of material over,
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about it, we have heard about that there is not so much choice, but it's right now, but it's the choice.
So the paradox that I speak here with name for moderne, which is the moderne, which is the variety.
That's frustrers, and this is the crazing you you guys told you you to do that expensive and sit doesn't helping kids don't help your money.
I say you the same about this thure, complicated choices -- they don't get a single nois: they were shape.
They make our life less life's lives.
If a part of what people in our society, in our society, in our society, all those choices where people have to be survival to be sure in the way of people are in the way of people on the another.
Also, all of us would be on the predict.
That's what economists and a Pareto-conservation call a Pareto-concerned it.
Everybody is better by reversion of the reversion of the other people, not just poor people -- and that comes from the kill, and that comes with us.
And so so you learn this image story is you learn this image story, you know, if you are saying, "Ach, what fish is there nothing that fish you know,
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scale example, a shortable, a shortable, that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I took about it, I started doing it, I started doing that this fish, I started doing this fish,
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you get the fish of the brain to create possibilities to create possibilities to create possibility, but lost the consupply of the brain --
If you get the fishing to create possibilities to create possibilities to be less tacks.
It lead to more lost and less and less testrange.
Everybody has a fish.
And this is free sure -- possible for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the weazy, the weazing of a figurement, is a cellend, united until right, unity;
Thank you for your attention.
