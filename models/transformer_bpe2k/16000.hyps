Last year I showed these two sdia's slides to show that the pool, who was the pool, who had been the size of the United Statand had 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the such of this particular problem because it doesn't show the didnâ€™t showing the ice of ice showing the ice of ice problem.
The ice ap on the North Poice is in a certain sense, in a certain sense, in a way,
It turns out in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I showing is a quick version of what happens happened version of what happened in the last 25 years is happening.
The permanent ice is double in the precise of the red.
As you see, it's going to be dark blue.
That's the year, that's the year, the lawinter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice ice ice five years older, five years older, that's almost like blood, that from the body sicks.
In 25 years is the way of this to this seeing to this in 25 years is
And that's a problem because the free-fors around the Northern Icell warms and there are a very big amount of woman frozen woman is frotation -- when the memore.
Commality with the total amount of definitely reinigation in the atmospher, that could be double as we describe if we describe if we describe if we describe the surround.
In some undeepe mate in Alaska borrely methane in the water.
At Professor was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another one different team to a different team to a different deep more.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is to be able to be that will be going to be that will be going to be that will be going to be that will be going to be there.
A reason for that, this is that this huge "warming Greenland from the north,
This is a melt squarter river.
The watervolume is echer larger than eye
This is the Kangerlussuaster in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea sea because the landyellow melely, it's mely, it's the place where it's in the sea is in the sea is in the sea --
These stromings are flu.
On the other side of the planet, on the planet, on the planet, on the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
Again, the last months of scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice ice has a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole is very quickly soon to the South Poile of underwaterawater-underwater-purposed to the shape.
The whole continent is to six meters sea set of seespiece of sease, like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two of ice massa, there are new notics, there are new noticed a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets the help of his drink-water of that melt melties.
In the Andes, this glestyle the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more stroys.
But when they disappears, they disappears are also drinking.
In California was a distribution of 40 percent in the snowed of the Sierra.
It comes to be in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are predictions are going to be there.
This global dreamed dreamed to a dramatic style of bosands.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen seen a fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly --
Four time in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the front 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at the both of a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 ton CO2 a.m.
25 miles every single day in our oceans, Kook at the east area of the Stile area of the Stilled, and every single sile of India, and then one of the Indian subcontinent there is a behaviors of the oceans.
The only big cause of the Earth, is the earth of the Earth, which is for 20 percent of the earth of fossil fuels of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stepped the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extens, together with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urban centrales.
But we see a circle of them
These are the voices of coales where the blown was annuated in the last years, and where green alternatives were alternatives were proposed to forget forget forget forward.
There's a political streed a political streedoming in our country.
The urban carbon -- and oil industry gave 250 million dollars to promote "scaled city."
And that image was doing something like something like this.
Round the guy became here, at home in Tennessee, about four billion litereracy belied.
You probably seen it probably in the new thing.
This is the one after one after one after all, in America.

I was an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I read back to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So I am at the time. For those who didn't waren: the LHC is is the biggest scientific experiment ever ended to have been seven miles in the end.
It has to be the circumstances that were attention to be less than a billion.
Enorm ambitius, d!
This is the machine under Genery.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one where I work. It's called the ATLA. It's called the ATLA. ASdetector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in attached so that you can see the scale.
At 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That worried for a fact in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle strole that hell around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which by particles in the detector in the detector in the detector of the detector of the detector of the detect of the LHC, which was a photograp
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September 10 September we knew that works is a huge overcome a huge over.
I don't know if this is the biggest across or this one to Google and saw that the Internet page of it.
That means we made a kind of a cultural as a scientific impact of scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of the scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of the science pact.
And a week later, we had a problem with the machine, what was going to do with these golden behaviors.
And those behaviors were 13 thousand calls of calls when the machine works.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they can do superidend his temperaturing.
So on minside 271 degrees -- colder than the space between the stars, that can deal with behaviors that stroom food.
In one of the connective between the neine of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive old in the LHC, was a constructive.
It was a wire set was a wire of electrical resistance against that 13 thousand ample of campers.
This was the result.
This is still impressive if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons of them -- and they were about 30 inches to be 30 inches of the power.
We had about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of them.
We all did them all reparent.
Now they're back to row up again.
Eind map the LHC again, the LHC again.
We will expect it again, and we expect measures in juni or right now, so we can go to explore what the building building the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have been incidentify to re-scientific research of scientific research research to work.
I think it's really hard to be so difficult that we go further than the LHC.
I showing the last words to the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to deal with the pasty of values of values of the values of the truth, his teacherling Michael Farather Farather is so dangerous for the progress of human minists of human mind to take our images of science that we are not a mysterions of the world's wise that we are not a new new world of the world's wishedying, and we are not not not not have new new new world to discushed that there are not not not not not there are not there are that there are not not not not not not not not not not going to discushead that there are new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new scientist that there are that there
Thank you.
I would like to start asking you back to ask you back to your children at your children at your children play.
And then then you discover to grab them up and they were able to deal and walk up and walk up with learning and describe by the way, and hands of space relations.
Ruilian insight is destrong is destrong with understanding the world to understand the world.
If an information inspired by the physical interaction with objects -- with objects -- together with objects -- with objects -- with my advisur Pattaction and my fashion Kalanii -- what if we would ask a computer of the computer of questions that would be a computer of digital vings that are moving to a kind of digital vinger who are information with the information that we can do with information with objects with the physical character that we can do with introffied information with with with with with the information
and ordering orders as we want to do that?
And these question of question that we decided to find an answer to see, by building Siftables.
Cort case is a Siftable interactive computer in a cow-size computer in a cow-cow-cow-cow-cow-cow-cows.
They can be moved, they can feel together, they can feel detect and they are detect a sharing and they are wireless contact.
The nuclear is the physical hands is the physical hands can be moved by graduate blocks by grab.
And the top of the first time, he was a example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And this is this helping is a more physical difference, are consciousness of their movement and even more of their movement and even of the way we move them to discover different new and fun.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is involved to tell a video to tell a video that plays plays and other other sand, and played the offician playfully plays played by the way to play a shaptable to play a video --
These interactive portraits of each other consciousness.
Indians in the next next to each other, they will interest to interest in the contradictions.
If they are going to be surround, they can also do this and what become some nervous way.
And they are movement movement and call.
We realized algaued algaue of the interesting result of these interactions, the use of all areas is, as as the extraordinary area of color as it was a fluid as a fluid of a fluid of the well-of.
In this example three Sifttables emmers to be able to go to go to go and use them to go and go to go and go to go and go to go and go to go and go go to go and go to go to the color in a very very very much.
And if we have threw up with the same time.
There are some of crippears for education for education, especially played game with language, and mathematics and logics that we want to give people to probert the result of immediately too soon as well.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci series by a simple programative.
Here we show a game that is a cruise between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single suspended on every Siftable, and fear words are increased in a wordarly book in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is the rescue, and differently and differently have a new series of heards with behind possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I made them to make a video of it.
They were actually actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this appropriate is that people don't need instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know what they need to do.
Here are some other people at testing tests.
That's our young best breedomest, right?
And it seems that he just likely the Siftables likely laught --
For him this were only blockyes.
Here is getting a interactive painted paint.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning about language.
This is Felix who demonstrate demonstrate it.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Sifftook with that character of the table.
Here he shows the sun come.
Video: The sun comes out.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene of the shape.
Video: The orange tractor.
God done "Yeah!
And it was a shaped of Siftables and then it can responding the carakters with each other -- Video: World War -- Video: World War --
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hiely.
DM: It's a story with a open fine.
and he decided to do how it way.
Video: The cat air.
DM: The last example I will show you today to show Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed develop, where every Sifttlessure of the lead, bass and pressure pressure and pressure.
Eentire one different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use
These sounds can be injected in Siftables are injected so that you can certain in it.
You put a sound in the pattern by the attached of a very Siftangible effects of a lost effects of a lost effects of reverb and filter.
They're going to be sound to a sound and added by change.
For the algemental effects like tempo and volume that are are advantage on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad of liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern by a first pattern by a extra lead.
And now I put the basline --
Video: DM: Now I feed fear of a slagy:
Video: And now I copy the movie on the movie for the presses, so I can influence the effect of it.
Video: DM: I can get it very quickly by the chance of the tempo blocky.
Video: DM: Now I buy the movie is to the movie more expression.
Video: DM: I can rescue the pattern as it playt.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise anything that I want to do to be able to do it.
In the finally finally demited by the resequences of the volume Siftable to be able to the left of the volume --
Thank you.
And as you can see, my passion is going to make new people's computer interfaces that are are better interfaces that are better on the way our brains and bodies and bodies and body works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of electricity that we are developing to show you in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this only is this only the attace is just the attace of the interacting with digital media, which is bring the information to our world as we want.
I thank you you to heart.
I look at them to talk to you with all of you all of you know.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life I am write for writing and I don't think that that will change.
And yet, there's an amazing properties in my life and career and career and career with my work again.
It started with a book, I was wrote undester a memoire: "Ets, Biddom, that very very contratratraveling to my first work, and a very very very contratravious exist.
The sequence is that people are all all over and always have to be told, and always do it in the time.
And the thing that -- member.
People come to me and questions to me and questions "Don't you have to evenar?
Don't you afraid you will stay your entire life will be written a book of the audiences where people will walk for warm.
Don't you get to be a job?"
Erg was represented to you, you know.
Of course, that would be very very very I remember about 20 years ago, I was a teener, I was a teenager, I told me that I was told I was a little little bit of the write I was going to be a little little bit of a teenager.
People said, "Don't you get succes?
Don't you afraid for education, that you will be able to be able by the way,
Don't your life to this work will be able to this work will be able to be able to be able to be able to strong on the puin your building, and you will be able to fal?"
Every thing in that streting.
In the short comes to this questions on that questions on this is "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are enough I am afraid to all those things.
All of the time already already --
But I'm also a lot of other things job, you don't know what everything for everything.
For sea whose for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time when that are angle.
Is the ration?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be able to be working for their people?
What is so particular is so particular processes that we make us to make the effects of the mine of the mind-emerged work at the mindset of work at all.
Take my father. He was scaled to be able engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that he was asked to him that he was asked to him that was not afraid to him that was not afraid to him that was not afraid to him that was not afraid to hi
And this is "John, how is it with your chemistry?"
No, no, so there was not about it.
To fair be: scemishing engineers have been able to be hate with the century hate to be sent a little manic-depressive alongs to be a little manic depressive alone.
Schey, who have these kind of reputation.
Not just writers, other other creative people have been able to be able to be the reputation of people.
Look at the grim of the dead of the most magnife creative minds of the 20th century.
I died young is often young by own own own does.
And even the those who don't have a suicians are not suicians seem to be able to be considered to be able to be considered to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be suicident.
In the last interview for his dead saw Norman said, "Must each of my books is a piece of message."
That's a little bit about saying about your life-lifes.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at it.
We all heard the first heard of them with all of the time.
The hemissing thought, is that creativity is that creativity is unlosing with list and that a artists will lead to celerate the end.
And I want to ask everybody here today I want to ask anyone here today?
Do you know, OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think I don't think about it, I don't think it's all a little thought.
I think it's a little bit of the representation.
And also even more dangerous.
I wouldn't like this this century also so good.
We can creative mind to be more more than we spore to live.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live in that dark gets in fact,
In fact, the fase that my career now is now in my career now is now
Go just na: I'm still young yet a saying,
I can think of a decades to be four decades.
And so, the way to be more more of the outside of the outside world as the work that followed on that outside outside of that outside outside of the outside of that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can sells you you know, hope to be selling my greatest success is behind me.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think about this is what you think about the morning, you know, it's like to the drank of the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be working with the work I love work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I am thinking about conclusion that I can just go through with written if I can do a psychological protect in the process in the process in the process of building.
I have to think of the written a securate distance between mind, and I think about the responds to the reactions, and my survive fear of the reactons on my future publics.
I found the last year, I found the last year, I found ways to do that.
I am in history and I do do do do a deep mind me in other civilizations to see or others to have a better way to help people have found a better way to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search towards me has been building me in the Greeks and Romdone and Romeins.
And then you know, because it's a long time and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Rombultions and Romestic was not that creativity of themselves.
And they believed that creativity was a godlean god-partment parentable places to the human became a humans and unknown reasons.
The Greeks called these guys called these guys called creativity "demonen."
And even Socrates beliefed that he had a demon who had a demon that time,
The Romestic had a species of the same idea.
Do him is a several creative creative creative me."
The funny is that the Romestic with a genius are not a particular.
In their policy was a genius a sort of magical godal entities that were ophisticated in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobs by the house of the households.
And when the artists was working on the work was read assistance.
And he gave it to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I have, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work work.
The artists was so in protecting genomes to be a lot of narcism.
If you work was brilliant working at the home, you don't have all the eer.
Everybody knew that was an unvisible geniius had holdes.
Where's worked your work -- you know, it doesn't only have to you, you know, not just to you.
Everybody knew you have, a pretty ones you have.
Lange time is that had been consisted how in the Wests was proted.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed.
There is a whole new idea: the individual human individual human beings is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, intend to mystic world.
That was the beginning of the rational housing households.
People believed that creativity completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individuals.
And for the first thing in history was in history about artists saying that they were not to say that they were not not to be a genile.
I have to say that I have to say that a great front of the wrong is a big front of the wrong.
To one person, one one person, one only individuals that he or they are the security of the century of the century mystery, the source of the mystery, of everything godnment -- that's something that is something that is something -- that's something that is something -- that's something that is something that is is something that is is a lot of human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun sket.
Egos are building, to gigantic propories and there are becoming incredible expectaborate high expectanious expectanially improportions.
And I think this drug has made the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists of artists
If that is, and I think is the question, "What is?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old back, on a old understanding of the relationship between human relationship mysterious mysterio?
Maybe not.
We can do 500 years of rational housing homber hombs in a 18 minutes speech.
And the most likely are in the audience people who are represented scientific scientific diswings with some efront of facts with some epoeder the work of artists to inspiring artists to inspiring up the artists of artists to inspiring the artions of artists of artists of artists with some of the idea of that elphysics of artists of the scientific that are of the scientif
It doesn't seem to me all of you will get to get you,
And I ask it to me.
Why now?
Why wouldn't we have those thought is?
It is just as much much hood as much much as all the other explanations of the total uncalculate uncalculate in the creative process.
Everybody who are trying to create something to create -- so all the attacks -- so that the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rationally rationally straight process is not always a little bit of the attacks.
And that sometimes almost paranorious feeling.
I've been incredibly away the great American closer Ruth Stone met.
And she's in the negentic of the neint. Her life all of the life write of them.
She told me about her youth on the platted,
Somes, if she was felt on the work was working on the work was going to be a close to get close to the country.
It was so said, "Well, as if there was a big wave air.
And so that I think about the country to her devoted than the country to her it.
And she felt that the ground under her food. And she knew that moment and knew that moment but one thing thing to do is a single thing to do is a life;
And she running to house, behind by the number, and they had to do as quickly as possible and paking.
When the close by her hate waves her ha waves was that her only chance to write it on the way to write it.
Sometimes she was not quickly enough.
Then and rings and rings it won't call.
And in this point is shaped by her universe, by her heavy -- in her search -- in her words -- in her words -- to another closer -- to another closer to another closer to another closer to another close to another closer --
And then there were even more -- this I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were close to get close the close to mist.
And then she was looking for house and paper and paper, and paper, and it scoods the close by her himself through her himself through her himself
Junew at that moment she had a potately.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plured me the close of the air.
She paked the close to his tail, and it back back in her body, and she wrote it back into her body,
In those cases came up with that cause the close to paper in the paper -- but then in the entire foundly followed followed followed followed up in the environment.
And then I heard that -- what is accident, I think, so far my creative process ey!
This is what my creative process not! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, who is a mouth, who is all the day on the same time and then so, and transform with blood, and transform with blood.
But even in that daily swrined that daily had some experience.
You will also be able to knowledge, that feeling creative ideas in your building, because there are a source you can identify impossible to identify.
What is that we are burn for bron?
How can we use it without that we are bee?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a while, I was a while I was a while I was a while I was an while I was a few years ago.
We had this go.
Tom is a big part of his life is a big part of his life was showing the toonce of the contemporary artists that are tried to get out of all the power creative impulse in the unconsequences to impulse it up to the impulsils that reflected to be able impulsed to get up in the inside of the consequences that are
With the ''d be able to rustiger.
On a day he was in Los Angeles Angeles on the fastly redictions.
As he heard there was so he heard a fragment of a melodie.
The decided to him, as inspiration that does does now, undecades.
It was a beautiful melods and he wanted to fasthor.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have any papery, no paperat, no paperror at the time.
The well-exciting exciting again, "I got the melods of the melots of the melods of the century behind me eight.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't work, he was not in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new ws.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry heard, you can't see that I sat at the point?"
"Do you really think I can write a songle of the song?
And if you really want to be able to get this song of them to be later even close to you,
And not go to anybody else else else.
Go neighborhood with Leonard Coh." And from that lose the process of lose different.
The work is the same thing with the known known in the dark submer.
But the sware exciting that the creative process in him represented the creative process of the geniiia.
The geniy was going to be close on the house and livered only to be a single of it.
Tom realized that there was no reason there was no reason to go to go.
It could also be a wonderful of a wonderful partment are kind of a conversation between Tom and the propertent aspect that not completely Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of working changed.
I had been profishing from it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddle process of Ets, Biddom.
And at a point moment I move in desperation.
You know what you don't want to do work but not good to do it is a terrible ramp of the book of it. The bad book. The bad book.
Not soil, really bad and really really really bad bad of it.
I wanted to go up the whole project of all of the project
And then I remember Tom that are going to be genius to get a posed to way.
I wisd to be my manuscrip, and I founded me to a very very much of the room.
And I said, "Lister dopying, we know all the way that if this book not just brilliant is not just by me.
You can see that I think there is all in what I've got in what I have.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it better.
Snap you now, you? Do you don't do you, thank you.
I just write because that's not a little work.
Oh, and in the notils are being died to be a cantor is just a differently.
Tja--- Usonce it comes up here on this notice
Euwood were in the North African desert people are in the North African desert of mathanlight to thank you in the sacks.
Urings and hours behind glors.
That was always wonderful, because the dancers were fully professionals.
But sometimes, some of course, happened to be something extraordinary exceptions.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you've seen ever seen anything in a performer.
It was like the time was the time and the dance and the dancer by a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of night thousands of nights of them.
And he seemed to be a long thing to be a human beings just a human beings
In him, under him blowed it lots of it.
A godly further, it was a hect.
If something destyle happened to be happened to clah, they started clah, and clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
because it was for them.
Trun, a fun historic fact, when the Moren Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanish Spanu --
The extent is echer by the century of "Allah."
And you know, that you have to stiered today and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments.
If an artists in Spanish something impossible or magically, I said, "Allah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, great, Allah, great, well, Allah, great, book for a well.
Our understandard, diseas: a glimp of God.
And the recipe of what we need.
Lasty is the dance is the far morning, the next morning, that he discovered on dinary sday to dinary 11 hours don't have a godd-lad-todal ladyer.
And at that moment he is a little parents of parents of cut with low-highly highly will never come to be more to such up to such up with it.
Maybe there's never been somebody else to do anybody else in thank you.
What does he have to do is now with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really difficult to sells for a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be so much to be not to be too high.
And imagine that you don't know about that the most unusual aspects of your person from your person from you.
And imagine you believe them a while you have a while you have a while not more more fuely.
And when you ready it, they are going to be able to somebody else.
And it was the way to be consists everything.
I hang innovel that thought of minds.
The last months I've been working on a book, which will be short to a little bit of a long time to be removed to a long time to be checked to a long time.
The opportunity of that illuster progress.
And if my mind with me to the hall, I love the same thing that I think about the same an: Don't be a contratraor.
You just want to work.
You just do you do things, whatever it's also wrong.
And if you are too thank you going to thank you.
If the godal genius is access that you have been decided to scale in your work on some of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful sources.
And it doesn't matter that not, thank you just go through the whether
And then, "Ole!"
I believe that I believe that I believe it.
"Olen!"" because we are pure human love and propertly, human love and propertissue by the propertly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, right?
You know, I've had been talking about some of these projects of these projects, about human genomes and what that can mean and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point of point, we were the biology to the digital code to go from those digital code to a new fase in the biology to go from this digital code to the design and synthesizing of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions to ask the big question.
"What is life?" is something that I think a lot of biolos have tried to understand in different levels of phenomaus.
We tried different approaches to minimized, it bring to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years.
And then we did the human genome, went from the analoge of the analoge world of the physical world of the computer.
Now we try to ask the question: can we regenerate regenerate to create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome.
And we tried to look at if we have a little little more smaller genome.
We can take a hundred of hundred genes from the 500 or who's are.
But if we look at the metabolic map is relative to the metabolical response.
Geloof me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch a piece of switch is to be a living cell.
We decided to do that the only route was to synthetism was to synthetise so we could deal with synthetise components to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we started to ask a chromosquit?"
Staat the chemistry it to make these very big molecules that we have never seen before?
And, if we do that, can be a chromosquito chromosquito?
A chromosquito is just a piece of chemically.
So, our tempo of digitize of digitizing life is requires on exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code of the genetic slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowed slowly slowly slowly, but is access is a slowly slowly slowly, but is a slowly slose of the genetic code to w
And the last point it would put on this point at this point at this time,
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some stages for some stage for a bio-ethic ethic ethic action,
But it turns out that synthesis of DNA is very difficult is very difficult to be very difficult.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making pieces of DNA is a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of the piece of them are going to be more fold.
So we had to do a new method to make a new method of these little pieces and corrigerate of all the follows.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little source that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, the foutcorrection,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the same part of a piece of chemical chemical chemical stone in the bacteria and the bacteria called code called code and virtually make the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the bacteria called the genetic code of the bacter
The virale particles were going to become the cells, they were going to go back and deaths and the E. coli. coli. coli.
I was a little bit of the oil industry, and I said that model with the oil industry, and I said that model but all of it.
They laugh more than you,
And we think this is a situation that is a situation that the software are are building in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of greater --
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosom.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we decided to build them in cassetttta in cassetttties in the cassetttes --
to go to understand what the indeed components of a living cell.
The design is critical is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information is very accuraft.
When we first first did this genome for the first time was in 1995 was the standard-precision one front of a 10,000 bases.
And eventually we found after resequencing 30 pounds. If we had the original sequence than it was not going to start to start in the way to start to start in the time.
And part of the design is the design of pieces of pieces of 50 letters that have to be able to consider the other pieces of 50 letters to build solid sub-one sub-one sub-on-one sub-on-one sub-on-to-one subject subject sub-one sub-to-one subject of the design is that we have to go together.
We design design here unique parts in the way to share in the time.
Maybe you may have been doing watermarket in the watermarks.
Bedity: we have a four-lettery called A, C, Go and T.
Trios of those letters cos for ruwrote 20 aminozurs -- that there's a little attack-pires for every aminoxygen of oxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words
Aanvanly we have been able to do anymore.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no purposed that there were no purposed to be follows.
We have these pieces of studying that we can eat them with anses.
There are enzyms that they repair and together.
And we started to make pieces of soks, and start with pieces of five to 7,000 letters were able to 7,000 letters who are each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,72,000.
In every stadium weeks, we have a floored of these pieces so that we could sequences a process that is very robuy very robuy -- that will be very robuy -- that will be very robbt -- that will sequences you see straight -- that will be a process of these pieces of stucksket of these pieces of stuck -- that we could sequences a proc
We try to do the point of automatiseration is to achieve it.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as we come to the real pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- more than 100,000 bases -- they don't grow as much more in E. coli.
And that explains the outside of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
And we went to remember another mechanisms.
We known a mechanism that "homologe recombination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair DNA can feet.
Here is an example of it.
There's an organized called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million radiation of radiation to can.
And you see that you see in the top panel, shem cromosome of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later, he was going to put it again in each other, exactly like the first time.
There are thousands of organs that are.
These organisms can be drood.
They can live in a vacuum live.
I know absolutely sure that there are living in space space that can be able to move environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is many of the way, there is a lot of the outside.
Here is a very determine microph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- fact with these processes -- fact with the right design.
And it is that they are automatically foot cartomatically feet.
This is not an electron-microscope photograph.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope of light microscope
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we were inses.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a duce structure.
The molecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then 142 pages of pages for the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code point of
Now, how do we started, how do we started chromosquito we have it?
With a virus is the clearly pretty easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simple, if you give you eukaryots, as we just know while you just know the cell of the celling and is what you know if you know about as the ready one.
In the bacteria species of chromospher, but we have integrated in the cell, but we have to show that we have a full transplant transplant to be able to invent a chromosphere to a different, and we can remove to a different, and the activity.
We have a chromosquitole, a chromosquito.
These are about so far from each other people, and mics.
We feed what extra genes so that we could select this chromosquito.
We have been contested with enzymes to make all the proteted.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be very evening graphic images here -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to soil but we tried to square what we tried to develop the process of moving out.
This is an essential evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosquitom or a third chromosquitos of day's day-properperties in one time to the species.
People who are evolved as if there are one people who changes have not been a lot of biology.
There are enzyms that restricti-enzyms are enought DNA is determined DNA is going to be enzyms that are actually enzyms that are actually enzymes that are actually enzyms are enought DNA is enzymes that are actually enzymes that are actually enzyms that are actually enzyms that are actually enzymes that are actually enzyes that are actually enzymes that are actually enzyms that are actually enzyms that are actually enzyms that really enz
The chromosquito was not to evil was not there.
The cell -- the chromosquito we stop -- well.
It was expression, and the recognized the other chromosquitoem as strange of material, and we had this one one of chromoses.
He was blue from the genes that we had put up in it.
And in very short time well-awed all the characteristics of one species, and he changed he completely in the new software that we put in the cell.
All the proteted, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code was changed the genetic code was changed.
This is going to be a genomics like genomic, but we are in the state of the software DNA, to change things.
Good, I've been paying to this scale that this is not a scale -- this is prebored on 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid paid that we may be able to make almost a new version of Cambrary explosion of the Cambrand new species of scale new species of scale new species of species that there are sear.
Why would you do?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what you need to look at what is needed is to what is needed is there.
We're going to go in ses-and-half to nine billion people,
To put it in my context to put it in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet...
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 40 years that there are four there.
We have to food, with food, with the heavy water, drugs for the six-and-half billion.
And that's going to be able to do that for nex.
We use five billion tons of collapse five billion of oil.
That's 100 milos of milos per day.
When we are biological processes in ogency or whatever process than also to replace, then that is going to be a huge challenge of challenge
Then there is all those carbon dioxide of the stone in the atmosphere in the atmosphere.
And by all our global discovery we have now now now now now a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had only a dozen different components, and you look at the diversity that is from there is present there is front of the diversity that is prevented from there.
We are previous imposed by an organic reality and our imagination.
We have techniques now, thank cell synthesemethods to do so-called combination genomics to do that.
We now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes or tries to optimalizing to produce octan octon to produce or drugs to produce or drugs to produce a little team changing molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just just standard a selection.
We can select for living skills for lifed, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen imagination of what real designer designs that we work, so that you can actually go to work, so that you can design and a new kind of computer in computer can design design and a new kind of design.
We don't know person how it will see out of the point of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of disease.
We founded on fourth generation of soom sell.
Our longs have seen flew to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation will come out from the source of sugars will come out to more high fuels like occurity of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology big influence can have a big food prices and the available and the availability is to read as we start with CO2 as his food prevent, and so that we are visual provide to design that we are vision the first fourth generation of that we do the first fourth generation of them are fourth generation and we think that the first fourth generation is to have the first general generation of the first of the first way to have to have the first generated generated general generation of the describes of the most of the ance of the ance of the first
And so, one method and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwide discovery are discovery are other method.
This is an organization that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the depth of see, about 2.5 miles deep, with coalthy temperaturies.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular waterstant as energy water stunke.
We're looking at the way or we can take CO2 CO2 and some easy of pipes can be able to fabrief, where that that CO2 and fabrief, to be able to fabrandster this process.
So in a short while we think we are able to think we're able to break on the basal question: "What is life?"
We actually have a little -- you know, the protected away the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do, where?
A important energy source is going to be a very important source of energy source.
But we're also working on this tools to be using these tools to think.
This year was the griculture, we always have a little bit more behind the facts of the floor.
I think that can change that can change from textom.
Here you see how the future can see the future can see the evolutionbom now is going to change the evolution tree of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and ultimately eventually eukaryota.
We are still moving to prove people.
Our goal is certainly to be able to survive to survivive to survivivil for a long time.
What I want to show you as a first quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft a year ago.
And it's a surrounded in which you local or on imming immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at the time, here many gigabies to digital images and can stay in this way.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big information or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel --
It all makes nothing because the only thing the prestates, the prestations would be able to influence on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a fully book, an example of non-image data.
This is the graue house is by Dickens. Every cold cold to be a heads.
To prove that it is really text, and not imagination, and not imagination, we can do something that really texty, this is not a really texty, this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange way to read a way to read a set.
I wouldn't be adapted it.
This is a realistic, this is an example.
Every big image image is the beginning of an underdeal.
This is really gives you really see the pleasure of a real paper of a real paper of time is actually a scale medium is actually a scale medium is a is a scale medium is actually a scale medium is is a scaling medium is actually a scale of a real paper ppers of the experience of a real paper of mediate.
We also have done something with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertising of high resolution -- much more higger than a normaal advertising -- and we have information -- and we have information.
If you want to see the capabilities of this car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make make sure that we can do the limit of hands through the screen of hands through the screen to do it.
We hope this pop-ups more pop-ups and other third flaul -- not need to be more flaul -- not needed to be more population.
Of course, the landmaps are amaps a lot of appropriate for a technology as then, I'll not spend one of this technology as a thing, except that we can also be able to spend a lot of this is also more more than we can also behavior.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
on top of the top of a image of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now now now live on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project called Photosynth, who two techniques two techniques of each other things.
A erfrom one is Seadragon and it's a very great computer vision of computer vision research of research of Washington the University of Washington, ago from Washington, ago at U.World Seitz on UWashington and UWash.
and Rick Sselfiski at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's the med possible by Seadragon.
And when we do this, you know, we see this -- that we have been experienced by the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images and the multi-resolution.
The space showed the images of the images is here is a meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images together, so they are all together, so they are the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they're genomomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized diashows are space images, and all these things are space.
I don't know sure if there is another time is another environments.
There are still a lot of space:
I want to like a Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked this summer is to the communicate of the communicate of this summary is the reality of this technique of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to do do do with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr. You just get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images from Flickr.
And each of these orange chick gives a image of imagination again.
And so these are all Flickr imaginations, which are imaginations, which are are coperated.
And we can do to a simple education.
You know, I never thought I would never be thought to work with Microsoft would be working at Microsoft.
It's overwhell here is so dealing to be so much as it to be so much as it explained to be so much as it expresent to be so much of this.
I believe that you can see that this many types of cameras are cameras are to mirror cameras a "Mory couple of it, a big number of place, a big circle of them.
I will try to find some strange images
There are so many vision of seeing faces and third this.
Ersomewhere between this is even a series of photos -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also choiced by the program.
If we have four found, in a phoster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do do is that we can do do this with social environment. This is now the data -- from the whole collective gets of the entire collective gets -- and the Earth is looked like th, and the Earth is all the time.
All these pictures are getting together and shapes a very little bigger than the sonce of the parts.
You have a model that from from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the entire Earth is
This is a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Aarth.
And this is something that growth in complexity, and also the use, and the preparts of the people who are used for the people who use it.
Their own photos are previous photographs are inved.
If somebody would like anybody would want to climb and their names and their names, then I get my picture of the Notre Dame is rich with all of those data, and I can use as a access to the space, which I can use metape with all of the photographs of cruise with this kind of cruise model, and created with all these kind of cruise experience.
And of course, it's particularly product of this imments of this imments of every interesting place on Earth, who not only only only photos, satellite images and other applieting, but also of images and other appropriate imagine is to be a collective photograph.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what your software possible, on a day, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are are being able to copy on the world.
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered.
It create, to your wishs, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that based on the data in the images.
And that is getting exciting when you think about the richchcheck of semantic information that many of these images are described of these images things that much of these images are going to have a lot of these imagins.
And when you look at the web for imagins, you feel a search and the text on the webpage page of information about what the imagination is a lot of information about what the imagination is a lot of information about what the imagination is a lot of information is a lot of information about what the imagination is a lot of information about what the imagination is to the web.
What if you are now coppated imagination is to all your imagination?
Then are the number of subjects of the subjects and the amount rich is that comes from that coming out of the front of that comes from there.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicians.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and events of events is the possibility to life between those who are not forget to live in the wind, who are not forget to the wind, the atraped in the wind, the profites in the wind, the protect left in the protect left the protect plants.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still still the galaxy is still a few galay: the mythes of Inchestris is more more than the Himalaya boodhood of the Himalaya boodhood of Dharm, you know, the demessage of Dharma, you know, the anthropology: the world is not only one in an absolutely but is not only one of the anshape of the engineering of the engineering of the entire thing is still in the anthropology -- is still is still is still still still still is is is is still in the world, but but not not not not going to make of the science of the scientiful shaviolding of
the result of a device, consequence of adadmitting choices that generations are generations of generations ago.
Of course, we all share all the same appropriate of the decline of born children. Breng children in the world.
We all make all inducation rites all intension.
And we're going to go with the uneval scaling through the box.
So it can't be surprise that we all all singing and art.
But interesting is the unique cadans of the song of the song of the dance of dance in every different culture.
Or now is about the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the Voodomic in Haiti, or the freeders in Haiti, or the freets in North Kenya, the Curandand-basic in the Andes-building bree-basic area in the heart of the Sahara. This is with the reisure. This is with the wood -- this is a moving with the reissue of the desert -- or noisian --
Everest, the godin-mother of the world.
They are learning us all different, we can think of the way we can think, different.
If you think about it, this idea of you can just give this idea of just feet.
Samen shapes the untelligentor of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural life that the planet and for her just as important as the biological life: the biosphere.
This cultural lives you imagine as a evil.
The events of fact that you can defining as the total of all thoughts, dromp of all thoughts, I was inspirations, and inspirates, and inspirit are previous imagination because of human imagination since the beginning of our conscious imagination since the beginning of our consciousness.
The eator is the great nalature of humanity.
And she's the symbol of all that we are and all of that we can be as amazing new new new sgives species.
It's not like the biosphere is the biosphere is the enosed that ooket -- and still in a much larger mate.
No biolist would be able to be able to be able to consider the half of all species on the point of extincluding extincluding out.
And the most optimistic scenario scenario is not even coming in the neighborhooks of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing is the losing of languages.
Then everybody here was born here born here was born sithousand of languages.
A language is more than her word-scree or her gramative rules --
A language is a flooring of human sell.
It's the vehicle that the disease of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century old old -- a century wold, a section of spiritual potential opportunity.
From that sixthousand becomes today is today the day of half of not the day's ors of fluister.

Is there something simple than to be able to be able to be able to get the last of your people's enough your language to have any chance to speak or the promiss of the previdence of the ancestors of the children have to see?
Presisted that tergene is sometimes the dead every two weeks, because every two weeks, because every two weeks, because every two weeks, and with him strong the last letter of an old language.
Some of you say, "Super, wouldn't be better than the world are not going to be better as we all all the same language of the same language of the same language. Or Kantonees. Or Kantonees.
Or Kogi.' You will have to realize how it would not have your own language.
So what I want to do is what I want to do is to reach a short reason front of the enosperate of what in fact, which is a picture of what in fact,
Many of us forgotten that when I have the talking about "another way of the other way," I really meanings of the way of ways.

One of the fascinerent steam that I've been lived with Waorani in Norani in Norani in North Ecuador, a blueful in 1958 village in 1958 vocact.
In 195, five missionaries are trying to explain to explain a critical old fold.
On the air, they were photographs of itself with friendly building, friendly in which they were never seen a two-dimensional image had never seen a second dimensional image image image image image had never seen a second dimensional image of themselves.
They got the pictures and tried to find the shape behind the shape of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face.
And then they didn't have anything to found, they concluded that the double with this piled, and then the crippears are speaking with speaking fairly fairly wrong of this is speaking fair.
But the Waorani was not only outside, but also each other.

If you take the plant to take the plant that a blue pre-cise room by your consciousness.
The plant is being mixed with blowing a coffee bear.
The plant is powerful tryptamines, narror because of brain, narroptine, dimethyptamine, 5-methoydimethydimethydimethyptashine.

And that poem your blaers, if you were seeing a little bit of a sea of pictures of the crazy images to a sea sea of electricity. This scoople of the reality of reality. This is not a shape.
I tried to try to convince my professor, Richard Evan -- a man who did the psychedelic timate at the psychedelic times, by discovery of paddodos in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that this tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinerend, because the effect are intrying, because the effect are intrying, there's no one more homome, because they are not to take the hallucination are not oral oral to be experience in the human darmic canalth, because they are devulnarmician: monoxia.

All cultures have always been sharing a dance of new living opportunity.
Technology is not the problem is not the problem is not the problem.
The Siou-indians are not Sioux indians are not Sioux when they were able to be up with the Americans stopped as that Americans stops to be able to be able to be in the Americans and way.

The pain of Tibet can be unrotable, but the contains of the people, is something to far to flay your food.
And finally, it comes to a choice.
Would we have a gray world of simple livity or we want to live a color or we want to be a color or whether of diversity or a color or whether or want to be a color writer to be a color write of diversity or whether we want to have a color or want a little bit of diversity to be able to go from a gray world of simple world of the gray world of a gray world of simple world of a gray world of the gray world

The modern industrial world is not still not 300 years old.
This surface this surface history that we have all the answers that we have all the answers that we will have all the answer millennia on our path.
If the untelligence cultures of the world to be asked the meaning of people, they answer with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that song that we are going to discover the ability to be exactly to be what we are are going to be able to be all the parts of the work and all the tuines to be blood. There are great moments of optimism.
This picture I have this picture on the northern point of Baffin Island then when I was on the arwal wal for narwal
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always frienly friends for the Inex. In the 1950s were placed to follow our soom -- in nder, in nedered the settations.
The opa of Olayuk weather to go to go.
The family peace for his life and unfortune all his tools are all tool.
Now you have to understand that the Intermine were for colle; they were using it.
The glass of their keys are wards originally cause of vis in caribookity.
Olayuks up was not afafraid for the poolnaight or the storm that were windodoing.
He went out, he went to outside, living to sea hundeny ses, and then inside his hand. And then the poep began to women, he was a limmet.
He brought a low-play set on the sides of the mes.
And then the solid was solid was a dog of them.
He was decide the dog and improvised a heart of hear.
From the ribbles he made a bad he made a bad thing.
He was looking at a hood in the neighborhood, and he was including poeps.
Over with nothing around with nothing about it. And then, in a lot of opvision, symbol for the Intermines and all the inside of the Interministry.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government is the inside of a piece of a piece of country is a larger than California and Texas sams our home.
It's independent area. They are independent on the ground.
It's a bluffing example of how a native enough gdoence.
And finally, I think it's clear to this high is at least for whom to this high is really, that they actually don't have too far away to this is not far away to get away to get away to this is not far away to this is not not far away to this hall.
They're sometimes home country.
They are going to be able to 20, the human imagination, which will go back to the beginning of the time. And for all of these children will will be the dreams of these children are of unflowing up of the unfloating geography of hope.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you with you about some question that I want to talk about some of the question that I have been a book of the question.
Maybe you might see paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explain some connected of what I was going to be a little bit of you've been doing you've been a little bit of the connected.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized together.
And that official dogma is affect to get the well-shape of our civil free of our neighbors on the highest levels on the highest level.
Freedom is a big good good good ded, an essential part of the human exist.
And the vendies are volving us to treat the way to treat their own inshapes to do a higher wheels without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice,
More choices like that people have more freedom of people have more freedom.
And more voluntomatically means cartomatically more well.
This is so deep getting together in our society that nobody would be able to do it.
And in our lives is this dogma step of all.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choices of choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
And at the first one of 75 can-clare threats there are in my supermarket virtus have been extra-viron-virtu-virtu-virtual gollow-virtual golly.
And you can make task your tase threats for the case of the case between 175 species for you, nothing to sit in them.
So that's the atted, I was worth of my supermarket.
Look at electronics wins. You can be double strong -- you can strong globe, cassetttespeler, radio, dio fortunatelers.
And if you have one electronics you can choose your choose from this number.
You can be a six-en-half million different systems together, with parts of these store.
Five -- you have a lot of choic.
Another another example -- communication.
And then when I was young was young phone services of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't take the dediculate it. You bought it.
That was the way that it had never been able to go to go.
And that time is forward.
Tegenic words are lots of different across ads.
And in cell phones is the diversity imments.
These are the cellphones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- who are with the m3-game player, and crack-fun fuelels and crack-fuel-fuel-fuel-fuel-fuels.
And you don't have this model that model you don't see this model in the winks, but you can sure that happens in the winke.
The sequenc: people come to the wincle and stell.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobile of buy that doesn't do much do.
And in aspects of life that are many more importantly, than the attention of stuff, is this explosive too single of choices a fact.
Gealth care, and it's in the U.S. is not the way you don't have to go to the doctors that you have to do what you have to do is telling what you have to do to do is telling what you have to do to do is not to do it.
No, you go to the doctor, and he says, "We can do A doctor, or we can do But, or we can do But,
As this previous forward and nadelivery --
By this previous ones this present -- and nad?"
And you say, "Dokter, what do you find find out of the thing?"
And the doctor, "A has this previous and nadelivers, and But, and took this present and nads.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was me, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own inbrings of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, which means the sware of decision of decision of someone with destate of things -- the doctors -- to a life's seask -- to a life's seask is not a seask of condition to take decisions. For including the patient condition to take a lot of recipal recipment is much more recognize.
And I think that nerd, I think that nere, because the goal, you can't buy it.
Why do we do them with them, if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we think we are the next morning, our doctors to ask that other mark to ask that other mark memories to ask that other mark is going to be able to ask that other mark is going to be able to ask that other market is to ask that other mark our doctors to ask that other mark
Our identy, unidenty, it's a ingree-faspect of our existing of choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is able to lose our background.
We find ourselves -- so many we just want to do but we want to do it.
Everybody morning, you have to think about what person you want to be think.
Let's have it talked about the housed -- the head.
There is a time that freedom everybody else looks at the car of that you could get as freedomatically possible to kids are very quickly soon as much as well.
The only realized was with why, not when and what you did was not when and what you did did did you do it.
Now free is free everything for the opportunity.
I give you very intelligent students, which I have done students, which I have done less housses than the whether than earlier houses.
They're not dommer than in the early than in the early time.
No, they have it pressure.
"Do I saw or not? Don't go to now?
Or I wait? Do I wait? Do I first children or a care?"
These are everything dealing questions
They go through to them, by the answer to have an answer to have all their houses and that doesn't get a good circle couple of them.
And they are right. It's important lifes.
And then we come to work. Carl just given all of that technology is going to be able to work every minute of every day -- where, in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place that I love memorim I love memory, where WiFi does.
I don't think that that because I want to keep the place for micking.
But good, who are huge choices of work in that we are working in that we are we, or we are going to work or we go to work, or we are going to work, or not.
We can look at a footbalthwed-bed sone, with our sone, with our sone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other sides on shoot.
And even if they all are of the way from that we are all the way of those depended with all kinds of questions: "Do I asked this phone phone answer?
So I think about this emails in this email?
And even if the answer is the answer is we experience the footbalthrow of our son a very different way.
And what we also look at the big, the small materialistic sees, life: life is a choose of choose is: life is a choose of choose of choose --
This is the world saw the world used to be used to be saw the world
There were some choices, but not everything was a question.
And this looks like the world looks at the world.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad whether or bad it?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we're good about about is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
And that huge choices has two effects of two effects on the human beings on the human beings.
A very contradictions is that the first one of lower is that it more lost than contains than confreedom.
With as many choicicians find people the lasty to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of it, a research to investments in volunteers.
A college of me got a college of Vanguard, a big policy data from Vanguard, a great policy with about one million employees with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 feet.
And they discovered that for every dealing for every dealing the worked on the took two percent determined the partnership of two percent determined the particular.
At fifth foundaries are destroyed at five than five founds. Why?
Because it in fifront of fifth is so much as much to choose that people are just choose choice to the next day, and that that I just think that I love it, and so on.
And of the extend comes decide to be dealth.
That doesn't mean not only that people after their pensive after their pensive bread because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money because they have been set, but also that the choice was so much as a little bit of the work-profeshibits.
And they were going to be 5,000 dollars a year to be 5,000 dollars a year to go to the nose of their nose.
The worked about the worked was a little bit of their own behavior.
And so many choices can be lose lost of choicks.
And I think the world looks like this is that the world looks like this.
If it goes to the century -- you want to go to the right choicky?
You don't want to be opposite with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we had the lost of our dissecing and eventually less bears are more than it would be less less than it would be more than the case that would be less if we had had had been less options had had been having options had had been having options and the crowd.
There are measurements for it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, you know, it was not perfectly the choice,
You ask you in this case, for that another choice would be more choice better.
This is dried the alternative is that you are saying that you get to get your choice.
And then so, so, depended on the enough of choice that you have made you made that you had even made a good choice.
How more options, des are doing it is to be able to have the box of unaway from the gets of elected options.
A second reason has to substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave morning, all of how often we depended on the way of things that we are dependent on the things that we are equire.
If you can intend to inthink, you can intend to be able to think of the alternatives you already desire that you determination that you were dealing your desire that you determination that you were destroy to be able to be the attract of alternatives you in the point of alternatives you a lot of the attract of all alternati
And that makes you fear that you have fear with the alternative that you have choes.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is a stel in the Hamptons.
They have a second wone.
They are at a wonderful strand. Stralend again.
Don't be right? "Don't be able to think, "Don't carry care.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city
I could flay my car, I could do my car."
And he is two weeks, with the idea that he was a great parking parking place.
Sometists are going to be cost of the enough we have to have our choice, even if we make a great choice.
How more possibilities are destate more contratradinary alternatives are there.
And that presents presenting to us as substitutional costs.
And another example.
This image storage of a little bit of points.
Life in the right here, and now for example, and you don't have to get things.
And another point is that you know, with every choice other choice other choice.
And all of the other has been so compared to be able to care the crazy is less attrack.
Ten third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this time I got my square to a new bounds.
I wrote almost always spirit always speaking.
And the far, there was one kind of stuff, and you don't thank you. The past totally doesn't believe that it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you don't have the bad enough and often enough enough and often enough enough to be enough the town.
And then I went to the winkle for a new again.
I said, "Day, I want to be a jump, this is my me."
And the winter said, "Would you smarter smarter -- easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know, if you have a rhys? Would you have you see-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed or acid-way?
Do you have a birth of the pile?
Would you be something extending pipes, or flink of piper." And so he went through it.
I was sprainal sprainy of it. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only one."
He didn't have any idea which was not a idea which was a hours all the possible bly bities are passion.
And then, I just just lost the winke, I just just explore the wink-initted brib.
I had been better. I could do the better as possibilities I could do it.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Okay? Okay, I wrote this must write a book of it.
The reason I don't feel better.
I started without any single expectancy because I just think one kind of stuff.
And then then there are different wars, and one of them would be perfectly perfectly perfectly perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I read my bird with my bircle with my expectations.
How more possibilities are people who have des more expected to expect about the deserves of that possibilities of that possibilities.
And that means that people are less bears are less with results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this is not know.
because in that case you don't know what I'm talking about now.
In the real thing is about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse.
because when everything was bad was bad was surprised experience.
In our modern society as well as a well-citizens, but the best perfection, but the best thing we can ever achieve is something so good as well as we had to expect.
No we are totally surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, are high around.
The secret of happiness -- this is for you, the secret of happiness is not too much more expectancy is not too much expectation.
I want to be here -- a little bit of a carbiographically elementally -- I am with a woman who is really fantastic is fantastic is fantastic is fantastic element.
I don't have a little less tester with less tester purposed to her less tacks.
But with less enough nees are good cants.
And finally, when you have a bad set at at the time, you can have a bad of preprecise of prehand, you can ask you ask to ask why you are inted.
The answer is that case simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different blows, and you coops to fall, you know, it turns out, who is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple. It's just so simple.
You had a better choice,
With hundreds of different works you don't have excuse to fals.
So if people decided to take the results of those decides of that decisions are good at the results of these choice.
And they take themselves.
In the western society is clinical depression under the younger generations under the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the young generations.
A factor -- not the only one of the end, but a significant factor in this explosive too single of depression and self-summerely enough experience of experience that people have been follow-food-to-front of high explosive experience of depression and self-explosive factor.
And if they are trying to explain the teleuralization for itself, they give themselves.
So the nettorious tate is that we feel objective to proposed to fellow our feeling.
At a little bit of a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be contravel for where you become from.
But that's not the way it is not to be there.
It doesn't look at a twice, it doesn't have better than not able to choose better than not cannot choose cartomatically that more choice is more choice.
There's a magical grounds of choicy possibilities. Wale, I don't know.
But I know that we have been able to be a long time to be a long time that choices are well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best one.
The choice, in fact, industrialized countries are coming out of material is fluence from material is flowed for the material is flowed of material is going to be industrialized from material is coming out of material is coming out of material is coming out of material is coming out of material is coming out of material is coming out of material is coming out of materi
There are many places on the world, there are many places on the world, where the problem is not so much choice, but right that there's a lot of choice, but there's a little choice of choice.
And the paradox that I speak here with this is that I speak for the moderne, which is the variety of West.
That's frustrers, and I think about this is this is that Steve Levitt told you yesterday -- and sunfruple of kids are not helping children are not helping your money.
I say you the same about this dure, including choices -- they don't help now: they don't do it.
They are less to make us less life's life's life's life's life's life's life."
If a part of what people are in our society is able to make all those choices to make all those choices that people have to have a little options have to be able to do all the way of option, the life of that people are on previous surface of these choices are going to be able to make all those choices of the people have to have been able to do all of the people have
And we have to go to forward.
That's what economists a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reversion of what skills -- not only poor people -- not only poor people -- and that comes by the last of choices that we with with our behavior.
And so you know, if you are this image story of the image story of the world, you know, "Ach, what knows fishing fishing fish.
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scale example, a shortily worldview was my first interpretation.
But how longer I think about it, I think about it, I understand that this fishing is the same smart is the smart is a smart.
because in fact, there's this one is the hand: If you get the fishing to create potential to create opportunities to create potential to create point.
If you get the fishing to create opportunities to create opportunities are enters.
It lead to more lost and less textack-peace.
Everybody has a fishing to need a fish.
This is volcan, this is really impressive -- possible for the fish.
But the desire of a figure of a figures to ask questions to ask issue cellend, unact.
Thank you for your attention.
