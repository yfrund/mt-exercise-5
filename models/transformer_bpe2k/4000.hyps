Fore I was going to see this two dia's set to show that the pools that the pools that the last three million years of the U.S, with 40-percent of the U.S, with 400-percent of the U.0.
But this is the scene of this specific problebecause the fic problebecause the didness of the the seaway of the the seeing of this specific problem because the fart of this specific problem because the the fart of this specific problem because the specific problem because the problem because the fart of the the problem because the dididididididissent of this problem because the fic problem
The ifar on the North phot is in the North in the climate of us heart of us and heart system.
It was in the winter and crimpt and crimpt in the source in the sour.
The next dia that I just just just a free of what the dead of what the last 25 years is the last 25 years is going to happen is happened.
The permanentire is a bit in him.
As you see, it looks like the shaping of the darker.
That's the year, the Earth of the winter.
And the crimpt in the shape.
The soil is the permanentire permanas, five years old or year, is the body -- that's the body from the body --
In 25 years is the of this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this
And that's a problem because the womoman because the North North IJIJIJera a very big and there are a very big big big fellow and cools and cools as the death, by microy-deththise in meth,
And then with the totale of the totale of the atmosphere in the atmosponce that would be able to be able to be the atmospone.
In some of a few ondiepe in Alaska relate methane of the water.
And then then the Profesor Katey Walter Walter Walter of Alaska with a different of Alaska with a different team to a different dippurare.
Why! She's OK. It's OK. The question is going to be able to be able to be able to be that.
And one really, one of that, is that this hums are the heart of the now, Gencount from the now,
This is a smell pelse is a smell of felt felt felt felt a smell
The waterer-volume is echter than it.
This is the Kangergerlussize in South South Groenland.
If you want to know how the seespiece because the seems because the country, because the country, then it's the place in the several of the several access of the several age.
These stroms are neight.
And the other side of the plane of the shapes of the South is the biggest of the size of the Earth,
And then the majortes are scientists that the entire continent to the entire continent to the whole continent
Meer is the founds of the South of the South of the South of the South of the felt watername is a few waters.
The whole continent for sox-meter seems like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the Himalaya, the size of the size of a few years ago, and there are a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's world's help the help of his drinkes that smell the fellow of that small.
In the Andes, is this glester the brothern of the slives for this stage.
There are more stroms.
But when they were respone, the fare, it is the drinkwater.
In California was a very, a very, a farishul in the Sierra.
It comes out in the waterreserires of the waters.
And as you could be the predict of the predict of the predict of the predict of the foot of the front of your life,
These are the food has been to a behavior to a behavioral stips.
And the number of course, about the world is the whole world is the world with a unmoney and never seeing the whole world is never seeing and never seeing the whole world is the whole world of course,
And there in the last 30 years, 30 years, the predicting 75 years.
This pattern is a lot of under to be under to be under to be a bunt big.
And if you look at a historic contexxy, you can see what happened.
In the last five five years have 70 million years have 70 million years of CO2 to the foot of the 24 hours --
25 mitos every day in our oceans, Kerere, Kerere, Kere, Kernal Ocevances of America, and every time and every years, and every Indian away from the Indian animals in the oceans, and a a falance or the oceans.
The only one big order of the shaping of the Earth, nature of the Earth, which is the front of phospities of phospits.
Of is a problem and step, and it's the smallergest problem.
The U.S. The U.is one of the two size expensix with China.
And there was a predict to build a lot more stead.
But we see a mire measum.
These are the steaged the ban was the ban was animals were anclude in the last last years and where group of the the last last years.
There is a political stroy to the connect of the gang in our country.
The steak -- and the stead of power gave to providual years, and the whether from the whether from a cool of movicickly a refololololie-a-industry.
And that image to me me to me me to me me to me me to me me to me me to me me to me me me to something of something of that.
And the cut was a cut me me thuis in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion to be a billion money.
You have the probably in the news in the news of seeing the news of it.
This is the one after one after one after the America.
This happened the Kerst.
One of the adversing of the stead of the strong was destrong was deaze.
Frosty "Wrosty the stead of the steaged of cool,
He is foot that is a lot of the America, and he are going to be able to that our economy for that our economy grows.
Frosty the stead is the day is with the day is the day is the day
He is a bigger and wattily and wells their batt."
Here's a big particular of the step of the step in West Virginia day.
The largest is the country is the country is the big bunch of Massey Coal.
Fos: Don't be a name of "Lake me like like this. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reatat, they don't know where they don't know where they have to have the pos."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Kliance for Kliance campagnes on the toman
This is a piece of a little bit of a lot of it.
For ideas "BOALwory, we see the climate changing the climate changing as a serious for our things.
That's the reason is the reason is the most important thing is to be a gigantc behaviors to the light of the light of the lives, and the foundation of the value of the value of the value.
Feit is not cool is not smarknew single is not smarknew
We find it is -- and it's -- and it's a little bit of the run is a cruping.
So, you don't have no care of climate change.
Let that but about us to us.
Video: Acteur: Schone step, you have a lot about it.
So we can see a look at this hypermodern scale scree scue fe of the hypermodern cool.
Fantastic! The machines are doing what is is the way to make what lay!
But that's the happiness of scene cools of scene.
And the fart that the fact that the fart of the most important important of the most important ordinary warming the Earth of the Earth is the maincluckools that you see here here is all the well.
And you look at the scree, this is the scene of today the day.
Al Gore: Einally phot the positive alternative alternative and that on the building.
Video: Stem: Stem: U..C. Con't the economy, the economy, the cliate crisis.
The rowire is the rows, is our dependence of phospits, like fours like foure fours and initial and indeported in the rowhether and saying.
But now is a foundation new oplosing to be a lot of this.
For the America of 100 percent of 100 percent whether than 10 years.
And a plan to get America to get to get a plan to get us to get us to get us to get the surface of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
And it turns out a opportunity to read our problems on our problems on our problems on the problems on the problems on the problems on the problems of the problems on the problems on the problems on the problems of the problems on to living.
Repower of the U.S.
Al Gore: And the first first of the first ste.
Video: Stem: Stem: Steve America to be America to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the U..S.
And one of the front ways to make a end ways to make a end of our dependence of old old them them to help our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: No investsts to create good papers to create create to create create to create creat.
Stem: Repower America. Tike to be realistic
Al Gore: There is a old Africance of the word that says, "If you want to be well.
And if you want to go to do a little bit of them in the far of it.
We have to go to go and far fare.
Thank you very much.
Fore years I was a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I think I was going to come to come to a couple of how that machine works.
So here is a lot of the degenes that are not the LHC is the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever ever education, 27 kilometer in the tomb.
And it has to the omics that was going to be able to be less than a billion than a billion the name of the universe of the universe to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition, right?
This is the machine Geneeat.
We photograps that min-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors -- 44 metor -- 44 metor -- 44 metor -- 444 meter -- 44 meter.
Spectacular photograph ATLASSSSSSSpecttane that you can see the scale.
And at 10 september of the point of the machine for the first time for the first time to the first time the machine for the first time to the machine for the first year.
This photograph by ATLAS.
And that are the fart of a fettook in the controllllam.
It's a photograph of the first particular that helped the LHC ging, and with the LHC on the LHCo that are in the the LHCwhere the deteces in the detector in the detector
And the other words, when we saw that we saw on 10 September of the machine we working that the machine is a huge of the machine is a huge of the point is the point of the photograph of the photograph of the photograpphotograph of the point on the photographotographotographotograp
And I don't know if this is the largest future, or when somebody to Google and saw the internetpages that the internetpages that the Interternet.
That means that we have a cultural as a cultural as a science of impact have a cultural pace of the creat.
And one week later we had a problem with the machine, what we have had to make this global behavior.
And that are amazing 13 thousands of the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the power of the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the powers ago.
The engineers are going to be saying, "Niet that are all the way of the things like this.
They can do that because they can do it because they can do it on the lage temperaturs.
So on the min 27, then the space than the space between the sterries that can behaviors that can be behavior.
In a of the connecnecessarily thousands in the LHC, in the LHC, in the LHC,
And then the she's the wire is a cird of indeal whether than 13 thousands of thousands of the thousands of the thirls.
This was the result.
This is still inpressive if you realize that magnets more than 20 and more than 20 ton on the nwewe'll be about 30 centers, and they were about 30 centers.
We have about 50 monkey about 50 monkets.
We had to have them out of the shaping them --
We all have been been been been been part.
Now they are back to wea.
Eind messive the LHC is the LHC intace to be able to be the LHC to be the LHC is going to be the LHC is going to be the LHC is going to be the LHC
We will be able to go to go to be able to metations in your your climate or not, so we can go to go to the the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of of the universe of of of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of of of of of of of of of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of universe of course,
And of course, of course, that unhappiness to be insent the debate of science the value of science is easy easy easy easy to work.
And I think it's the fact that the fact is the fact that we are going to be able to be the LHC.
And I shows the last words on the English scientists are the Humphane, I think the death, the des of the value of his lives, his lives, his lives, his lives, "Naves, "Nicharar, "No whether the expresent of the maincludge that our images of our images of our images of the fours of our imagine newles, that are not going to be e--neighborning, "The imagine news, the the the the the the the the the fty of our mymymymymymymymymysters of our our exexexexexpreson't are not respon't have have have have have have have have have have been been been been ststststststststststrong that that that that that that that
Thank you.
And I want to ask to ask you to ask your child, when you know, when you know, when you play with blocks with blocks with your blocks with your kids to ask your children to ask your children to ask your children to ask your children at your children children to asask with you,
And when you discovered how you to move them and they were to get and behavior, you know, you know, you know, you know, to the home, and then the hangs of space relationship of space.
Rimals are insix is the power because with the understand of the world to understand us to understand us us to understand us to understand us to understand us to understand us to understand us to understand us to understand us to understand the the world
If a inform inspion, the name of physical interaction of physical interaction with objects -- and my advision and my advision of Kanaliithi -- what we asked me -- what we asked me -- what we would asked me -- what if we have a computer that if we would be able to ask a kind of the four inforforward of the pususual exciting that we could do with a a little bit of the free-free-frow of the equifree that that we have a a a -- and the frowwellifisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisis
and ordents of the ordents of we want to do it?
These question is so so we have to be a answer to look at the responce of Siftables.
Cort with this is a Siftable a a interactive computer of a cookyet of a cooky-h.
They can be able to be able to the hand they can be able to be able to the movements and they are a scree and they are a scree and whether and she's ret.
And the follots is the physical hands are just like blocks like blocks to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a block of the food.
Body's Siftables a example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital inforestial inforest.
And that this hully has been a more physical different, are are going to be able to be the movements and even the way we move them to be different different and different different and different different and different actinclude in the interactable to discovering the way we discover.
And I will start with some of some simple example of course,
This Siftable is institution, to tell a video to tell a video to tell a video and others and others are playing to be able to be able to be able to be able to play a crapy.
These interaction, are are connected to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the interaction.
And Indians are going to be able to each other, they will be able to each other.
If they are rings rings they can also this and what can also do this and what single can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a single of them and then they can also this is also the sone.
And they feel move them and hell.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting of the interesting of these interaction, the use of the Interternal area of of the scene of a small of a small of a foot as a foot of the foot of the sour.
In this example of three Siftables and I can use them to use them to use them to use them small of the global gmental gmental gmental garar,
If we have been follows, we have to go back to what we went back to what we have to go back to the back.
And there are some of a crather for the education, for the education, and then the education of the calculate and the cells of the ability to be able to be able to see things that we want to see the result of the inventions.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci by a simple programatic programms.
And here we see a spel that a cruissue is a cruissue and Boggle.
And the principle is that you want to get a wanted to get a child of the Siftable, and then the words in a words in a words in a words in a work.
And after about 30 seconds is the healthy is a lot of series with heart a new series of the ability with heart.
Thank you.
These are some of the kids on the Media Lab, and I am am in the Media Lab, and I am a video to make it out of a video of it.
They were working about it.
And one of the most interesting things that are not going to be able to do things are not the future.
All what you have to say "Mod" and they know exactly what they have to do it.
Here are some other people on the tests.
That's our young biggest bate, reat the nightor
And it looks like he looks like the Siftables well.
And for him this was just blow-blow.
Here is a interaction.
We wanted to make a platform for the line of tape developing.
This is Felix that demonstring.
He can see new carages in the scene, by the Siftable with that caraxtable with that carage.
Here he shows the son the sone.
Fo: The son is it.
David Merrill: you have a tractor in the scenee-built in the scene-building.
Fo: The orangle actor.
God, day! Yeah! Yeah!
And it was scive the scive of Siftables and the nature of the cara-ftables with each other, Video: Wel!
DM: and and so are so his own story of it.
Video: Hol!
DM: The end is a story with a bit of the end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end with a story with a story with a story with a story with a story with a nature of the end end end end end end end with a him.
and he decided to the government
Fo: The foundare.
M: The last example that I think I will be a synthesizer and Is a synthesizer and the responce that we have the responce of the responding of the responding and the basic prepressions and pressions and pressive the four.
Eengineer, has been a different variations, where you can be able to use your want.
These happiness in the sounds of Siftables that you can see the pattern that you can see it it self.
And you see a sound in the pattern by the pattern Siftable to be able to be a likely of a controllllet and filter.
They are going to be able to a soundation and institute to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a sound.
And the almost of the almost effects like tempo and explore that are going to be able to be the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Fo: DM: We begined with a lead of the Siftables, to a first patterns to a first pattern.
Now, I think of the basice.
Video: Do I feel what I means I mean, I mean.
Fo: Do M: And now I go to the filter of the filter of the filter of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the filter of the effect of the filter of the physics.
Fo: DM: I can be a very very foot to the changed of the tempo blows.
Video: Do I get the filter of the filter of the filter of what more expresson.
Video: I can be pattern the pattern resciping the playing.
And I don't have to be able to planns, but I can make improvises, it very long and the very longer and make it very longer and I want to make it very long and I want to make it to make improvision,
And the end of the dimmmbers of the evolution of the volume Siftable to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the dimmmbers of the dimmmmms.
Thank you.
As you can see what is going to make my passize to make the new peop-computer interfaces that are connects that are going to be able to the way our brain and bottes.
And now I had the time to be one needs to be one needs in this design design and with some of some of some of environments that we develop the developing of the lab.
The days that I want to talk about to make this one is only the foot is to a very new generation for the interacters, and the interacters, and the information media, that we wanted to our world to our world to our world to our world in the way we wanted to our world to our world and the information of the information of the information is the information to our world that that
I dance you know, I very much.
And I look at the way to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to do with you all all of your alls to do with your all.
I'm write write
And the crite is my work, but also a lot more than that,
My living country, I'm going to be a scree and I don't think that ever will not change that ever will change that ever will change
And in the same onlanguage is going to be able to be able to the lives, and career in my work with my work with my work with my work with my work to see
The began with a book, I have been on a measure moire, "Eaves, Buppor, Beminnen," Beminnen," that very in the environment to my work in the International working about the International exist.
And the population is that people are always always always always evily to be like this.
Why is -- does does -- right?
People are asking me and questions, "Ben you don't know that you don't know that that you can't be be able to eventure?
And you don't know that you are not not the entire lives, but never make a book more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more
You don't know there are not not a bad of it.
Erunner-stststitution, you know,
And of course, that would be very expension, I remember 20 years ago, 20 years ago, I was a tiener -- if I told that I told that I was going to be a teachief.
People said, "Ben you don't have never be success?
Do you don't know know that you don't have to educate your education to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to education.
And you don't know that you are your life on this work is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be on the public of your build?"
Its in that that are in that too.
In the short is my answer on that question: "Yeah,
Yeah, I'm interesting for all that things that are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be enough things that are enough things that are enough things that are enough.
All time
But I'm also a lot of different things are not not not know what we want to know that that are not not not know
For example, and other image things.
But what is the crite question I asked me to the last time that anglobal day.
Is the ration?
Is the logical that somebody is a lot of the work for the work for the work for the work for the other see?
And what is so much more to creative processes that we make us to make us the effects of the effects of the effects of others that we have been doing doing something that happens.
No nother ther my father. He was write a artil artil I can't remember that there was not remember that he was not a bad of a bire to him a bigger for a big.
So of "Yohn, how is the with your chemypy?"
Not it was not about sproted.
Of fair to be write arentire eurs have the century of the century of the century, the reputation for study stustuff for the represent coals.
Scheat the requize of reputation.
Not only scree requice, other creative people have reputation the reputtation of the reputtation of the instaby.
Look at the grimmer dom is the most magnife of the most magnife of the 20th century.
And many stive young young of the future.
And even degenes that not the self-order pleasure to be able to be able to be able to be swead.
In the last interview for his food said Norman Mailer: "Met every of my books is a piece of mitself-fishing themselves.
That's notice what to say about you say about your lives.
But of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of the craising of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of of this kind of the kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of the kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of of this.
We all heard the first one, and we heard the sells of the tells of the tells of the too.
The universe is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is with lifs and that a artists will be able to be able to be able to be able to tell tell you to tell tell tell you to tell tell you to tell tell you to tell tell you to be able to remove the responsize to be to be
So why I want to do everybody here here are going to do you you do with that idea of liv?
Finitit?
Because I think about a good about about history, I don't know it helped the helped of da,
I think it was the weather is the wead.
And also even even even even even though of it.
I don't like to see that this century is so foot so on.
We can creative to be able to be able to lives.
And I know that it was that the for me, in my situation, without the situation, without to the dark of the dark da,
And the fase of the fase in my career now in my career now now now in the career
Ga but I am am a young year.
I can have a lot of four decar r r r r r r r
And then you know, it's probably going to be more more more more more dience, the most of the world that are are the work that is the work that is just the connect of the incluence of the work book.
We are with friends with friends you can be able to be well-wells the write of the largest success of the size success is the size successful --
Jemig, what is a idea!
If you think about you know what you know you know you know the ocheat the fours to the dours of the dare.
So I don't want to do not.
I love me love me with the work of the work of works.
The question question is, "Hoe?"
And I think of the conclusion to the conclusion that I just can go through the conclusion as I can be a psychological inability in the process in the process in the process in the conclusion of the conclusion of the conclusion in the conclusion of the conclass of the conclusion as a long time.
And I have to create the scree of the fart of the deadictions, and my felt and my felt to the responsions for the responsions for the future.
I have the last years, I have the last year.
I'm in the history is a history, and I have been deept to see me in other people's shaps to see a better way to help a way to help with the emotional complications of the emotional complications of the creative process.
My several has been built me to the Griest Griess.
Let me because it's a long and invital story.
In the time of the old Grieks and Romenes and belief people don't creativity was not creativity of henomenself.
Most that creativity was a godnment was a godnment was a responsible places to the ments and invention, to the ments and invented to responsible to responside.
The Gries: The Griesed and the creativity "As demonen."
And in Socrate that he believed a demoon that he had a demone that he was influistere.
The Romenes had a spectable to be idea.
And they have to have a become a behavioral creative a genidence of the creative of the creative of the creative of the creative of the creative of creative the creative of the creative of the creative of the creative of the creative of it.
The grapper is that the Romenen't a geney with a genet.
In their believe was a genee of magical godnment of magical government that are rehistory, in the murs of the artists.
A little bit like Dobvivil the house of Dobvivil
And if the artists was the working on the genassion state the genet.
And the face he was going to be shape.
Brillian! That's precis! That's precise the psychological psychological described the results of your work.
Is a writing how that in his work in his work work in his work work in his work work in his work worknew that in his work in his work in his work in his work work.
The artists was so in the tecism.
If you work work was a brilliant you don't have all the eat.
Is a write that a unvisible gence you had a slikely of them.
And you work on your work working, then you don't just like your old you,
Is a whether you a nogal onhangal onhance of had.
Lange time is that that the Wests in the Wests was described
And when the Renaissance and everything --
And there is the fart is a new idea: the individual ments is the middle of the universe is the middle and mysteries.
And a space for mystic weather of the government of the godnment of the godnment of the godnment of the godnment of the godnment.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People belief that creativity of the indivivividual found.
And for the first time in histories was about artists says that they were not a genet.
And I have to say that I have a big foot of this.
Om one person, one enkle indivivivity that he was a fount of the essential is the essential -- the essential My mystery, of everything -- which is a lot of everything -- is a lot of the present -- is something that is something that is something that is a global human regible for a global recorder to be synthissue synthish.
Also, you ask the son the son the son on the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son
Egos are are resions to gigantic provivioral protect regic improprostates.
And I think this is the last 500 years are the last 500 years are capot has been working.
If that's what is, and that's what I think is the question question "What are are "What are are question?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old time began to a old relationship of the ments and the creative mysteriax?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years rationship we can make 500 years of the homest.

It doesn't seems me you all of you all of you will get in the will get in the will be in the time.
And I ask me to me.
Why nois?
Why would we do that da, we wouldn't move to move that we wouldn't move to move that are not move that da.
The farch just just so much holds of the other elections of the totally sells the other ones that are the creative percent that are in the creative percent of the creative process.
And Is a that has been been able to create -- so in fact, and so that the entire responce -- that it's not always the creative percent not always to be rational.
And that some of the most most most of the parance of it.
I have unlong amazing American diches Ruth Stone was disaf.
They are disafe in the negential. Here are write to be dispone.
She told me about her yourrself on the plattold of Virginia.
Sometimes when they were on the followed the work was a disent the sone, the night of the country.
It was so said that he was like a big golf love to croly.
And this is a sight gold, about the country to her future.
They feeling her foot her food her foot to whether and whether her to do that her to do it on her to her lives, and the left for her leves.
They rought than the home, and they were able to get the diversent and they have to get so quick and paper and paper and then then it possible to pay and then it to see it.
When it was disight by her hund her holds was that her entire to scree the scree to scree.
Sometimes they don't have been able enough enough one.
And then running and running the home, but the house is not to the house
And in the way to be whether it was disead, the fare, the many of the many of the many of the follows -- to a different diter.
And there were a lot of -- this is the nice -- this is the nice -- that they are the story -- that they are the story -- that they have the diseage.
And then they went in in house on the shapes and pay the diseaged by her head.
Jue on that moment she had a pottile of paking.
And with her other hand, told me me so, the shaped them out of the air.
They were the sight at his strong and the strong back back back back back to the bottty, as they were the surface it to be the surface and the crapy and the crapid and the crather and the fare.
In that are the case came out of the shaped in the shape, but then then in the paper in the cassuch of papize in the caspapier,
And when I heard that -- what I thought -- what future is so front my creative proces!
And it works my creative percent no! I don't have no medium!
I'm a musile's high in the same time in the same time in the same time and then it with blood and transforms and transforms and a works.
But even in that day's sowells I have a lot of experience of experience of experience of experience of experience
You will be able to do it it is the cassuch that there are creative ideas in your operate ideas in your inventificidentificate of a crapy of a couple of a couple of the possible of the entificidentify of the things are are possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
What is that that we are for bron?
How can we use it without that we are working about it.
And in a way that are good for us to us us to is?
The best contemporaged to think I can think of this is music.
A few years ago, I was the time I was a time for a time for a time for a time.
We had to be this.
And to get a big part of his life is a big part of his life life is the shaped of the heart of the making of all the making of all the shavior to get the under of create ate that equive in hihim that has been equion.
And the 'd the 'd To what was going to be a little bit of the years
And in a day day in Los Angeles of the felt of the strong -- and changed the process of the process --
And as he heard the heard he heard the fragmentous of a melodie.
The shaph head, like inspiration that is device, inspiration that are pultellend.
It was a beautiful melos and he wanted to fasthous.
But it didn't know that that we don't know it.
He had no paper touch a paper of the took at the took at the face.
The whately spance of the spance of heath, "I ket the melos that education, and then the eight century of the century of the century of the eight century,
I'm not good enough enough to be not."
He didn't get echeter in panion, but he state that whole mental process and destate the entire process and destening something news.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry and said, "Sorry you can't see that I heard the stud?"
"Do you really really really now I have a love of write can be write a low?
If you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it for your high time for your time.
As not, not, somebody else fall.
Ga neighborn Cohend." And then then the process is the process of them are lots of them very others.
And the work is the self, with the same way with the done, with the dark of the darket of the dark of the dark is the dark of the works.
But the shapes that creative the creative process in history in history, when he was a gence of genion.
And the genee thing to disight and left the shaping of the high and responside.
And to have no report that there was no reason was to go through the education.
It could also a wonderful wonderful sarch of conversation between To and the describes and the most of the To that not help to be able to be able to be able to do it was not not help to be able to be able to be a kind of the TT
And that story has been changed.
I have been a profishing of haps.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bidd's scree Bidds.
And in a gives of a flolow.
You know that that is not good work and you want to be able to be a different, you think it's a different. It is a different.
Not a bad chenge of challenge of it.
And I wanted to do it to do it to do it to do it to do it to do it.
And when I remember To to his geney, and I decided to be a powerful single of the point to be a power.
I wendge my manuscrip and I was food and ridge to me to me to a lege of the cridge of the cridge of the cridge of the cridge of the cridge of the cridge crip

You know, I have the one of these projects about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what can means and what it can make it means of our sets of genes.
We started to do a new point of the biology of the biology of the digitaliss, and now we try to try to a new fit in the biology to a new fase in the biology of the design and synthetissue of life.
So we always always always try to do the big questions.
"What is something that that is something of what many biolos have to understand the way of biolos to understand on different nives.
We have different athere, we tried to minimal connect to minimal components.
We are now now now the digitalissue of the digitalissue.
And then we were the human geney, we had the way from the analoge world of the analoge world of the biology, to the U.S.
Now we try to ask question we can do regenerate the way we can create new lives, we can create the digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of the digital universe of the future.
This is the map of a small organization of a little organization of the colorgest genitalium, with the colorium, with the choom of that challenoratory in a laborator.
And we have to look at a name or we have to look at a name of the name can be able to be able to be able to be able to look at a night.
We can have in the order of hundred genes of the 500 or so, or so so so so that are so so on.
But if we look at the metabolic clearly relationship is relationship with the once of the one.
Geloof me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can see a piece of the very unlives, it's very unlives, it would be a lives.
We had to do the only roud to explore this was to be this chromosople mosople mosople and we could be the components to be able to the most fundamental question and to ask the most fundamental question to ask the most fundamental question of the most fundamental question that we could be able to asion.
And so we are starting with questions, "Cunning we asked a chromospose synthetis?"
Staking the chemy that we have this very big moleculture?
And if we can do that that do a chromosop-assuppos."
A chromosope is tried to be a piece of chemical include material.
So, our tempo of the digitalise of life is responential education.
Our required the genetic code code code code lows, but is the future, but is the fun of the genetic cocode of the genetic code code code code code code code code code cocode
And our last point would be on this moment on this moment on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago,
There were a number of cradia for the innovitian ethic future.
But it turns out the synnthrow of DNA very difficult of DNA very difficult that the synnness.
There are times, there are in the world that are in the world that little stuckes DNA making 50 letters in the same generation of the years, and it's a degeneration percent of the stuff of the stuff of the stuff of the ff of them.
So we had to make a new method for the way of these little stuckes and the corrigate of all the folds.
And this was our first poging, with the digital information of the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi of the digital information.
That's a little four rus that bacteria --
We had to the stuff of the foundation of the founds.
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 literal literers.
The spending of the spart when we have a including chemical state or in the bacteria and the bacteria and vironments and virtual cogs and vironments and vironments are going to make a inclucke.
The virtual particles were when the cells of the cells, they came to go back to the E.
I was unlong gs in the oil with the oliestry, and I said that they said that they said that they said that they were model to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the ololied.
They are more than you love more than you,
And why we think this is a situation is that that is the software are are hardly hardly in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of great.
We wanted to build the foundly bacterial chromosopportunity.
And that's more 50,000 letters are 30,000 letters genetic cost.
And why we are we actually build them in cassettts the cassetttes, so we could the cassettts that we could be the cassettttes.
And to understand what the city is the cell of a lives.
The design is crucial information in the U., and if you start with digital information in the computer that are very accustacracusts are very accustate information in the computer that are crucial information in the computer of the computer than the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer that is crucial information in the computer of the
And when we were the first genome this genome was the fart was the stand-precision one follove one follows.
And in the way we could be able to resequences 30 followed the spire sequence had not to use the order of the spire on the spone.
Our part of the design is the design of study study of study and the other studge that have to the other studge of 50 letters to build a little bit of the sub-con-fources that we need to build them to build them to build them
We are going to be able to be able to be in the environment.
Maybe you have a lot of that, we have waterable to state waters.
Bet, we have a four literator: A, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, and T.
Trio's so's letters cos for the read 20 -- that there is a simple of the responce is a simple for every one of every one inoxy-inoxy-inoxy-ozers.
So we can use the genetic code to be the words to be the words of the genetic code to be the genetic code to be the genetic code
Aance we have a signs of the animals are just just mout.
Some were no teleurns were no disevers were no disead.
We have these studge are so so much that we can get them to eat the enzys.
There are enzy's sings they are repartttate and in the other seting.
And we started to do with these care of them to start with stuff that five to 7,000 years of 7,000 years of the hundress that are separts of 24,000 letter, and then then sets to 7000.
In every stadiles we have a flowed of these study stuff that we could see them in the case that we want to be a process -- that will be very robbly -- that you will see that you see -- that you can see it.
We try to try to do it from automatissue to do it to do it.
So this is a basketbalmost finale.
As we are going to come to the really stuff -- more than 100,000 ases -- then then then then it doesn't easy easy more in Ecoli.
And that responding the modern of all modern molecular biology.
That's why we are we we going to do the other mechanissues.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination is used by the biology to be used by the biology to repartttes, that stuff course, that stuff can ff food.
Here's a example of it.
There is a organized by Deinococcus radiodurance that three million radioduring to be a million radiod---od--enduring to can.
And that you see in the both paney, a chromosople of the another.
12 ot 24 hours later sears to be able to be able to be able to be the first first of the first first of the first later.
There are thousands that are thousands that artice.
These organizes can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a organizization
They can be in a facuum left in a facuum left in a facuum of life.
I know I know that there are living in the space can exist, that can be able to be a new aquatically evicicical.
And then then you know, the way that there are going to see there are there are there.
Here's a little bit of the molecul of the molecul that we have been doing with these processes -- which we have to be with these processes with the right of the right of the government of the studge.
And then they are doing it to that they are automatic food.
This is not a electronen-microscope photographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotograps.
It's a big molecules that we can see the with a light of the light of the sicroscope can see the coop of the coop of a light of a light of a light.
These are photograps, about a period of sours of sods.
This is the audiencation that we are unlongs.
This is more 50,000 letters at genetic cod.
It's the largest molecule ever ever ever ever been by people, with a thousand-structure.
The molecuulple is more than 300 million.
If we would be the pressure of a 10-point without the front of the genetic pages of the genetic coa's present the genetic code
How do we started to a chromosople mosople mosop?
And a four rus is the four easy easy easy easy easy easy easy easy is the four rus is the four rus of easy easy easy easy.
And a bacteria is the much institution.
It's also simply if you can be able to be eukare, like eukare, as euks, and you know, the cell and you know what you know what you know what you know if you know, it's going to do it as the cell as the cell of the cell as you know,
And we can see the bacteriial is the chromosople in the cell of the cell we have a follows that we can see a follow of a chromosopportunity to a cell and the activices of a cell of a cell of a cell of the food.
We have a chromosople sexyy-aged of a micromosown.
These are about about about each others and musics.
We foot what extra genes and we could do for this chromospose for this chromosp.
We have the converted, with enzy-single stuff all the equired stuff of the equired to make all the equired of the single of the shape.
It was woman as as we can get this in the cell -- and you will be the very very aged -- the very very examples here -- the new chromosophim in the cell.
We were to developing it to be able to be able to developing the process to developing the process of the process of the process of the process of them to developing the process to developing the process of the process of the way to developing the process of the shavious.
This is a essential evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered a second of the chromospose to the chromosphere are a third of the thousands in one more than one foot of the foot of the different foot of the species.
People that evolution are going to be a teaching more biology is not much biology to be a lot of biology and evily the evolution of biology that are not much more biology to be able to be a lot of biology and evily evolution to be a lot of biology evolution of biology.
There are enzy's enzyers that are restrictims are are enough DNA responsizes that are restrice.
It was not chromosope that in the cell was not eed.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we have to -- which we are --
It was express the required the other chromosople as a strange as a state material in the cell with the cell with the new chromosopportunital.
He was blaw up to the genes that we had to strong in the genes that we had to strong in the genes that we had to get it.
And in very short time and all the carakists of the carages of the ene of the ene of the new sof, and the new software we fare, we had the cell we had to cell the celarages.
All of changing changed the membrans -- when we were the genetic code -- when we were the precissues that was changed.
This maybe this maybe if genomici-alchemy, but we are in the state, by the software are the software are to change things to change things to change the software change.
And I have been been been been been been a scale -- this is not a scale -- this is the predict of 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I have a new new expensize that we might be a new explosion of Camamic explosible explosize where there are in a big species in this new new species in the new new species that are a new new species in that that we have a new new species in that that we creatature is a new new species of the fronronronronronronront of a new spectable to make
Why would you do this do?
And I think is the wome, it's womban as you look at what there is going to see what there is going to look at what there is the wome.
We go to go to be a short of ses-half billion people, and then the next 40-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year----en-----------------year--year-year------year-----year-year-en-en-en-en-en-en-en--------------------------en--------
Om in my contexttook the way to place, I'm built in 1946.
There are three people on this planetetets.
And for us in the entire in 194660; it will be 460s,
We have to have a food with the food of scales of whether water, medicine, far--en--million--million-billions of the million.
That is going to do that for needed to do that.
We use billion ton cold, more than 30 billion followers of follow.
That's 100 bilos a foot of the foot of the millios a day.
When we are biological processes in ogence or the scale of the write of the consisiside.
And then of course, of course, that cools in the state of the state of the state of the atmosphere
And all our world's discovering our world's discovering the discovered with about 20 million genes, and I like the design that would like the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dog different components, and and care are from the diversity that is from the diversity that is expresent that is expresent to the diversity that is the diversity that is the diversity of the diversity and care are of the diversity to the diversity that are are are different of the diversity of the diversity
We are explore by a biological reality and our example.
We have now, thank ank thesesemethods are going to do something like the combination of the combination of the combination genomic."
We have the possibility to build a big robot that a million chromosomes a million chromosome.
If you know, if you know, if you know, the converses, or tried to make it to make it to make occare to make occature or or medicdicial of the paccinate with a small of the caccess of the last biology than the last biology than the last years.
And it's only a lot of nessage and the pos."
We can selecters, for lives, chemical or productic or productives, or productives, and so on.
This is a scree image of what is a real design design of what we are we going to work on the connect of the connect of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what we can design design design in the computer of what we can do it to be a scree.
We don't know what it will see it looks like this.
We know what their genetic code is the most of the imals from it.
We went to go on our fourth generation to our four four four fourth of them on our fourth of them on our fourth of them to four four four fourth of us on our fourth of them to be on our fourth generation
And our countries have to evive your ethanol a bad experiment.
We have second second to generation the generation that are going to be able to be able to more more hope to more more hope to more more and like occurrench a lot of different different types of different types or different kinds of us or different species of the ents of the fol.
But the only way we think we think that biology can be able to be the food food is the food and the food is the food is as we are the crainate as a starting with CO2 as his food as his food, and why we are we flolows, and we have the way to make the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do about 18 8 differentire mamaking about 1118 to think we we we we we we we we we we we fourselvvvvv
Sonliving and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's discovering the discovering of the discovering of the global of other method.
This is a organized that we have been reach in 19966.
It turned in the diepice, about 2.5 kilometer diep, with coalthough to temperaturs.
It makes a methane with the molecular of molecular air water-water-state or as energy or as energy methance.
We are going to look at the look at CO2 to be easy easy easy to be fabrate to fabrace that CO2 2 to brought this process.
So in a short time we think we think we think we think we are in the basic question question question question question question is "What is the basically question questions, "What is is the liv?"
We have been able to be able to be the describes the petrochemical industry to remove the petrochemical industry --
Yes. If you can't do this to TED, where then then then what?
A important energy is a important energy very important energy energy
But we are also now now now now now now to use these working to be series to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use the couple of these work.
This was the year, we always have the foot of the feits of the feits of the faccin.
And I think that can change it through the teaching of teaching the faccinate acccinate the clude of textine.
And here you see how the future can see the future of evolution, now is going to be able to be the responce of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukare.
We have been far to read the responding of people.
Our dock is a chance that we do a chance to make a chance to do that that that that can do you do to do that.
And what I want to show you you you want to see is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a different technology to a year to a year.
And it's a bunch that you can be able to be on the way to immental follows in the visual data
We look at many gigabytes of digital images and can be able to be able to be on the nature and the terms and the terms and the ters, and the ters.
And it doesn't make it out of information we look at the big thing that are are images of images or images of images or images
The most most of his normal camera photographotographs, but this is a sof, and this is a sof, and she's shaps, and she's shaped in the 300 meapxel of the fare.
It all doesn't make not like the only thing that would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to a third system, the felt of the scree is the scree.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a free-front of notice data.
This is the graue of the foot is by Dicknowledge is a heath,
And to make the evidence that the tily is no image that we can see something that this is not going to show that this is not the image that this is no images of the images of the image of the image.
Maybe this is a bit of a bit of the way to left a e-book,
I wouldn't be able to be able to be able to be able to it.
This is a realisticer example of The Guardian. This is a example of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a deattell.
This is really you really see the place and the experience of a real paper paper in the real paper of medium medium medium medium is a scalend medium is a scalend medium is.
We also have a little bit of these explort of the Guardian.
We have a nep adversed a nep resolution -- many of hoto, much than a normal advanced -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information of information -- and we have a neight.
If you see the possibilities of these authing, you can see the hier.
Or other models or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to be able to be the behavia care of hands that we can do the scree can do it.
We don't need this popular is no popular more means and other people are not more means -- not more means -- not more means -- not more means to be more means -- not more means and we need to be a population of the flauns of the flauns of the flauns of the flauns of the flauns of the flad----hours -- not neigh----ffffflaw-
And of course, his countries are a lot of the hand the future for a technology for a technology like this.
These are all the U.S.
And the followed on a image of the NASA SA SA SA SA SA .
Let's look at something else.

What do you want to do you to do?"
And you'd say, "Dok, if you know, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm going to be not."
And we call "own incluence of the patien."
That is a clinks very positif, but means that the sware are the shaping of the shapes of somebody with somebody with somebody -- the doctors -- the doctor, somebody who is not seems the condition is not the condition to make the conditions of the conditions -- the recororipipatients are are are the recevesesesess.
And the described that ners, because the way to be able to be able to be able to be not not to get them to be not not to be not not to get them to be able to be able to be able to be nership
Why are are recorder we don't do them to get them to get them to get them to do it.

Our identity, a fingingle aspect of us aspect is now now now now is now now on this disafe on this dia seage.
Our identition is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
We are invention, like this. We are doing -- so fare.
And Is o-o-o-on-to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the surface of the person to be able to be able to be able to be able to be to be able to be able to be able to be on the
Let's do it about the house of the house of the sound.
And there's a time that is a time that free-automatically equickly as write that you can be so quickly as as whether as whether as as whether as whether and possible to children
The only working on the only choice was not when you read and what you are the next thing to ded.
Now you know, it's going to be everything for the surface of it.
I was educated with with intelligent students, which I twin-intil percent of mind to be education.
They are not not dommer or or clucy than the earth of time.
No, they have the pression with chuzes of choice.
"Sometimes I don't have no not?
Or I will I wait? No I was children children, or a caree?"
These are all all of questions.
They are going to have a answer to have a answer that they don't have their hombs and then they get a good casking and then no couldn't be a cket and then it does not a lot of the cell.
And they have the way to be important life life questions.
And then we come to work. Cargave that technology us in the idea that technology in the day of every minute to work -- in the Randolph neighborn Hotely folph Hoteltel.
And there is one one place that I love a place of course, where Wii the Wii the do.
I wouldn't be able to be able to mout.
But eight is a huge choices of work in the work of work in that we are still going to ask us and we are going to ask us to be now.
We can see a footbaldge of our sone, with us look at our sone, with us to the environmental phone, and our laptop of our laptop of our laptop of our laptop on the scale.
And even if they all all of the took and we all all the minute of that weath, "Do I ask this phone?
And I know on this emailtyour reager? Sometimes I write this brie?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is, we food the food food the food of our son a very different ways of our sone.
We also look at the group of the small of the small of the color, listion, the listion, is a craid of cooket of coups.
And so the world are the world assuch of the world are the world early earlilier of it.
And there were what choices, but not everything was a craising of cood.
And so it looks like the world is now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now the world
The question is Is this good or foot is good or foot of the question is good or foot of the question is good or food?
The answer is: "Yes."
So we all know what is good to do it is going to do it about what there is going to be able to it.
And this enormous chicity has two effects has two effects on the ments.
And a very explain is that the first one, the first ones than the first thing than free than fre.
And the kind of choicick people are the lasts to make a choice.
I love you a very viviral example of investate in the free of investate in free-enneroplans.
And a collet's go to investment to investment the investment of Vanguarguy, a big exploring with about one million neighborn about 2,000 nes of a million needs.
They discovered that for every timities are the working working the working working the working on the particular of the particular process.
And we are five foundares are the deaths and percent of less than five than five than five than five fone. Well right?
Because the way the fifound-foundle is to cut to clasts that people are the choics to the next da, and that read da, and that rop, and that rop, and so on.
And of the expenside.
And that means don't know that people who who were no high to eat the name because they have not enough to educate the choices that the choickly that was so flaster that they were so far to be so much for the equial for the ded.
And then they were lots of them to 5,000 dollars a year to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to be 5,000 dollars.
The working about that was a calculate to read their own behavior.
To many choicity can be responside.
And I think the world is that the world by the world is that the world is so from seet.
If the century century, you want to be very foot the right choice chumber, right?
You don't want to be sure with the wrong with the wrong wrong or even the wrong or even the wrong and even the wrong of the wrong of the wrong of the wrong sell.
That's the first effect. It's the second effect is that we had the free is the fart of us and cut the deaths and the result of us and the result of us as we have the case as we had to remind the less we had to have less less less less less less than less than the deded.
And there are measure redents for it.
One is that there is that there is that there are inventions, and then it can be able to be able to be able to be able to be perfect the choicice.
You can see in a case for that a few choicickly to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a case that would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in a case of the choice.
This is the drink of the alternative to get your spired to get your choice.
And then the way to do your brain the following of the choicky that you have a good choicky and they were a good choicic.
How more optations are easy easy to easy the way to have the invention of the healthough of the costs of the costs of the costs of the costs of the cells of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power.
One is the second has been doing with substitutions.
And then then the gave gave of how fish we have the value of things that are the things that we are the things that we are doing with the things we are doing it.
If you can be many alternative initidence you can see the inventional changes of all the alternative that you have evidence you have evidence you can be able to be evidence your evidence.
That means you get less less bire with the alternative that you have to get your mind to be includ.
A example of the Workers the New Yorkers are excuses.

And he was two wears there are two weight, with the idea that he was a great parket of the idea that he was a great parking.
And the ance of the follost of the follows, even if we have a great choicics we have a great choicice.
How more possibilities are dester more intential alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternatic alternative alternative
And that are going to be able to us as substitutions.
Another a example of example
This image story, you can get a number of points.
Let in the one and now now now now and you have to government.
Another is that you have a choices is that you are shaping with every choicic.
And all that other has been so his invitial changed by the cassupposed by the remind of the equired of the cell.
And then, the esescalation of responside.
And I came to this in the room of the new bigger to a new bitself.
And I whether it's always heart to be able to make it.
And the most of them was one kind of the spire and the cost tom and thank you you know, the point of the power of the foundation of the boundable to be able to follolowed and flolowed the felt of the to.
And I went to the wind wind for a new new for a new new new for a new new set for a new new of the wind for a new new 'd
And I said, "Day, I want to a spire is my work."
And the winles said, "Wilt you slim slim or relaxed with relaxed relaxed with relaxed relaxed with relaxed relaxed for relaxed with the phit?

The reason I don't have to be a felt with all that choicic, I was that I was more starting to expect the front of a good speak.
And I started without without without because I was a kind of spital responsible to know
And then then there are different wards, and one of the foot of following perfect.
And what I was going to be cheat.

In our moderne to make a produce of the ability to be perfection as a various perfection of what we could have a good thing we could have a good as much as we had to have a little bit as a little bit of the dewaits.

And if they are the teleurns for itself to be able to be able to be able to be the wult.
And the nettoria is that we are objective objective to go out of the foot of fell felt and us felt feeling to felt it.
Another a care a couple of fare.
This is the found-dogma, that is the foot of everybody is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it is the official ma,
