And I showed these two dia's to show that the pool, that the pool, who had the pool, who had the pull of the vastate of the vaastoms of the vaastom.
But this is actually the nice of this particular problem because it doesn't have the didded of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice skin on the North Pole, in a sense of the clopping of our global climate system.
It was going to be in the winter and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summing and crimpt in the summing and crimpt in the sun.
The next slide that I shows is a version of what happened the last 25 years is happened 25 years is happened to be happened in the last 25 years is happening.
The permanentire ice, in the room.
As you see, it comes out of dark blue.
And that's the year, the major of the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer in the summer of the summer in the summer of the summer in the summer in the summer of the summmmer in the summer
The so-called the permanent, five years or parent, is almost like blood, that from the body, that from the body.
In 25 years is the one of this to this to this in 25 years of this to this to this in 25 years is to this in 25 years is the way of this to this one.
And that's a problem because the fors because the fors of the North Icope and there is a very big amount of foot multiply fellow of woman, in the death, when it onth in meth, in methane, in methane,
And the total amount of the total amount of the atmospher, that could be explore the amount of the atmosphere.
In some of the undeep, in Alaska borrelt methane to all of the water.
And last winter to Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of Alaska with another one.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is going to be that will be going to be going to be that will be going to be that will be going to be that will be going to be that.
A reason for that, this huge of warming bron" Greenland from the north of the north of the north,
This is a smell patier.
The watervolume is echer than echer than echer than equative to the waterror.
This is the Kangerlussuain South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea sales because the agricultural is the place where it is the place where it is in the sea is the place where it comes into the sea cut.
These stroming needed to be able to do it.
And the other side of the planet on the plant, on the South Pole, the biggest of the biggest ice smass on Earth.
And the last month, rapport scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole of the South Pool is very quickly in the name of water-water-water-water-water-water-foot waterat.
The whole continent is to six meter sea little bit of sea little bit of the Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the one of the biggest ice mass smass, which a few years ago, who were still a couple of years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of his drinky water of that smell smell in the smell of the global population of the global population of the world's population of the global population of the world's population of the world's population of the global population of the global population of the world's population of the glob
In the Andes, this glester the sources of drinkwater for this city.
There are now more strobs.
But when they disappears, the drinkatch water.
In California was a reducation of 40 percent in the snow, in the snovel of the Sierra.
It comes back in the waterrors.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions
This global dreaming to a dramatic stize a behavioral style of foods.
And the number of course, the number of nature, with a incredible and never seen a rapidity and never seen a fasty.
Four time in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the front 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at the botttch a historic context of a historic context of here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 axton CO2 hours --
25 miles in the ocean in our oceans, and look at the eye area of the Stillean area of the Stilles, and to every single of the Indian ans, and to every single south of Indian ans, there is a behavior in the ocean in the oceans.
The only big origined of the Earth, the earth, which is the exciting of the Earth, which is the reflection of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stepped the whole biggest problem.
The United States, one of the two biggest extinctions, sams with China.
And there was a lot more city's to build a lot more citys.
But we see a measure.
These are the city-carbon centrales that the bombs were annuated in the last years, and green alternatives were preferenced forever.
There's a political streezed to the gang in our country.

And I gave years I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I got back to come to come with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am notic. For des that there are not warent, the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever end, 27 miles in the enombic.
It has to care the environments that were able to be less than a billions of the universe of nesses that the universe began to 600 million times a second of 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, d:
This is the machine under Genevil.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the ATLAS detector -- it is the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the atbice.
And at 10 september set of the first time we put the machine for the first time.
This picture picture was called ATLAS.
And that carefore for a partnership in the controlllam.
It's a picture of the first particle that help that hell that hell helter in the LHC ging, and with a set of the LHC, by a piece of the LHC, by particles in the detector in the detector stricks.
And with other words, when we had that picture on 10 September that the machine works, we have a huge government.
I don't know if this the biggest across or thing, or then, or then, and saw that the Internet page of saw it out of saw it out of saw it as from saw it as from saw it.
And that means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact impact of the impact of the impact of the impact that we have made a cultural impact that we have a cultural as a scientific impact of a scientific impact that means that we have a seen a cultural as a a spect.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to make this golds.
And that draws 13 thousand of cample camps of the power works.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small be.
They can do that because they can do because they are superaturs.
So on min 271 degrees colder than the space between the stars, that are behaviors that behaviors that behavior.
In one of the construction between the neine mongnets in the LHC, a construction of a constructive.
And it was a wireless something warmer, and there was intended to that 13 thousand camps.
This was the result.
This is still inpressure that is going to realize that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of the power to be about 30 centimeters.
We cicidents about 50 mongnets.
We had to get them out of story, what we did did it.
We all took them all the time.
Now they are back to way.
Eind mands will be the LHC againtacks.
We will be able to remove it and we expect to measure or not, or now, or now, and we can go to the challenges of the universe of the universe are building of the universe.
Now, of course, that they have unhappiness that incidents the debate of scientific research. It's easy.
I think it's so hard that it is so hardly hardly that we go to the one of things like the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I think that the defines of the truth, the defines of his true experiments of his life-ling experiments of his life-fara-such Fararather than the excited, in the excited, of the human mind that our imagery, that our imagery, in the natural world that our imagineering world's newspaws, and no new myster, and then that are not a new mystern to be a new mysterions in the foundururbitions of the last last words of the world, and that we have that we have that have have to be exexextententions of the newspircishead to take one one one one one of course that one of course
Thank you.
I would like to ask you to ask you to ask your children at your children with blocks.
And when you discover to graduate how to gray it and conscious, and you were actually problems to the teaching and hanging the teaching and hangs of space.
Ruimtelevise is strong is strong with the world to understand us.
If an information is inspired by the nest of physical interaction with objects -- and with objects -- and with my adviser Pattion and my adviser Jeed. Jeedth, I began to ask me -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer -- in the engine, in the engineer, in a finger squarter that they can be able with a fluence of the confluence of the conflap, the information of the conflow-graphysics that they can confic with with with with the information with with with with with with with objects of the ffffoundomer information with the information of the introduct of the fount of the same same same same same same same same minminminminminminminminminminmination with the nenenene
and we can ordered order, and as well?
And this question of us so contains that we decided to be an answer to built Siftables.
Cort collabort is a Siftable computer to a single size a cooks.
They can be able to be able to be able to feel their movement detect detect and they were able to be a screen and wireless to be act.
The nuclear beginning is the physical handely, just like blocks can be able to graduate them by graph.
And in the way of Siftables a new example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that this helped this this is a more physical different, are conscious, and even from their movements and even of the way we move them to discover and other other other and reads and other other other interactions.
I will start with some simple example of the example example of imagins.
This Siftable is instituted to tell a video to tell you to be able to tell a video and others played to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
These interactive portraits of conscious.
Indians can put together, they will be able to interest to each other.
And if they are ringly ringly it and can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a single and can be able to be able to be able to be a and can be able to be able to be able to be ringd.
And they feel they movement and doctor.
We realized algaw that one of the interesting condition of these interaction, the use of the interaction, the use of the interaction, as it excited, like it was a small of a color as it was a low-flow-fluence.
In this example of three Siftables of the circles for and can use them to a color in a lost of good,
And if we have focus to go back to the back back to what back back back to that.
There are some of the education of the education for the education of language for the education, mathematics and logic, and the result of the ability and the result of the possibility of the immediately.
And here I -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci by a simple response of a simple response program.
And here we show a game that a game is between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single literally gets in every Siftable, and the cird words in a word's words.
After about 30 seconds it is the rescued, and different, and differently with a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursix to the Media Lab, and I'm in the sense to make it out to make it and make a video of it.
They were really really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this action is that people almost not instructions are not needed instructions of the most interesting of instructions of the most interesting things that people don't need instructions of the most interesting things of almost interesting things that people don't need instructions of the most interesting things that people don't need instructions.
And all of what you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people on the tests.
And that's our botta tester, right, rights foundation.
And it seems that he was just the Siftables wrong.
For him this only blocks.
Here is a interactive painted painting.
We wanted to be a platform for the teaching of language for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate that demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate that demonstrate demonstrate that demonstrate demonstrate the demonstration.
He can bring new cararters in the scene of the Sifttable with that carrer with that carrackarararter of the table.
Here he shows the sun comes to come up to the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene area.
Video: The orange tractor.
Goed "Yeah! Yeah!
And so it scuue of Siftables and the neart each other, he can respond to each other, and the nearly -- Video: Wither -- Video: Wither -- Video: Wither the cararakters with each other.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Helt --
DM: It's a story with a open end of a open end.
and he decided to do how it affect it.
Video: The cat the bate.
DM: The last example that I will show show Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have developed recent a sound producing produces and pressure pressure and pressure presses.
Eengineer, our different variation, where you can choose what you want to use what you want.
This sounds can be injected in Siftables in the pattern to be the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern in the pattern itself in the pattern in the pattern in the pattern of the pattern itself in the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the number of a likely Siftable effects like reverb and filter.
They are being able to be sound and touch and contented by chancing.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are conditioned on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: M: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, lower by a extra lead.
Now, I place the basline.
Video: Now, I feed a little slagwork on a slagwork
Video: And now I copy the filter of the filter of the filter of the presses, so I can influence.
Video: I can make it it in the offices of the tempo blocks.
Video: M: Now, I'm the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can rescue the pattern the pattern as it playt.
So I don't have to plann, but I can do all all the way I can do it very longer and shorter and shorter as I want to do it.
And in the end end end the dimmp of the volume of the volume Siftable to left side.
Thank you.
And as you can see, my passion to make new people, my passion of new peop-computer interfaces that are better in the way our brain and body's and body.
And today, I had a time to show you one new election in this design area of election that we develop in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the attace is just the inside of the interacts for the interacting with digital media, which the information to our world as we want to bring the information of our world as we want to bring it to our world as we want to bring the will.
I thank you of hear.
I look at the way to talk to you with you all of you to talk to you.
I'm writing.
Bukkkkkkket is a lot more than that.
My whole life for my whole life and I did all of writing and I don't think that ever will change that ever change.
And yet, there is something like to be something like in my life and career in my life, and I had to see my relationship with my work on my work on to my work on my work on the same time.
And it started with a book that I have been writing a memoire: "Ets, Biddinner and the very very in the same time, that very in the entirely to my first time the entire world and an international exister and an international exist.
The sequence is that people have to be told me to be told me to be told me to do it.
And the thing -- member,
People come to me and questions to ask me and ask you can't be this success that success you can never be able to evenar?
Don't you care you going to be able to be able to written writing a book that people will never be a book in the warm.
Don't you get to be a job?"
Every high-restitute, you know, you know.
Now, course, that would be very -- I remember that I remember 20 years ago, I was a tiend, when I was a tienth, I was writer that I was writer to be a death,
People said, "Don't you get success that you never get succes?
Don't you get to be able to remove to suppose to such a suggest?
Don't you know that you live in this work is that you will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be on your buildings with your buildings with your bitters, with your bitters, and you have a bitters,
Its in that streting.
In the short comes to ask this questions on this this is "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all these things that are enough.
Altime of the time of time.
But I am also a lot of other things afterterward, you want to know that for all of the time.
For sea wear things, and other engineer, and other things.
But what became writing to write myself to the last time that angle today.
Is it ration?
Is it can be somebody to be a jobs to be to their mention for their mention to their mention on Earth are se?
What is so for creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the mind of the mind of the mind thing to do at other.
And I can call my father. He was scaled engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that he was worked on him or he was a cut to him or he was not afraid to him or he was not a job.
And so that of "John, how is it with your chemistrack?"
No, there was not about it.
To fair be: scales engineers have been able to be able to be the century of the century of the reputation for piece of manic, depressive coholists are at the centurholists.
Scheator writers have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers are also other creative people have to be the reputation mental reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the right.
Look at the grim of the grim ddental doctors of the most magnife creative gests of the 20th century.
Many stiered young, often by own it.
And even the degenes that not move to be suicians seem to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a suicians.
In the last interview for his death, "Miler: "Miler: "My every of my books, and I think of my books,
And that's a little bit about your life-life work.
But of this kind of excited we don't look at it.
We all have the first one of the first and have it with my and accepted to my and accept it with them.
The universe is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is with list and that a artists will be an artistate to cellend.
So why I want to ask everyone here today, you know, that idea of life?
Do you do that OK?
Because I think about it now, I think about it now, I don't think about it at all.
I think it is the weather swking.
And even even dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see that this this century is so good.
We can creative gest a lot better atspors to live a lot better to live in it.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be to live to that dark in that dark in the dark of the dark of the dark of my situation,
Surker the fashion the fashion in which my career now.
Go took me me a young, amper veat.
I can still be four decades to work on the decades.
And the Hooperprobably will be all the auicer world that is going to be all the outside world as the work that is followed on that outside the outside of the outside the outside of the outside of the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside of the outside the outside of the outside of
And we are with friends under the another, so I can be able to be able to be slikely my grandgest success.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think about this is going to be able to know the morning, you know, to be needed to the vil.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be a working with the work I love of work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long after long think, I think about the conclusion that I can just go to write with writing a psychological protection in the process in the process involved.
I have to create the writing of the writing destate between mountains and my government and my survival angles for the reactations on my future publics.
I have seen the last year, to ways to do that.
I am in history, and I have been doing me in other civilizations to see or others to be a better way to help a better way to help a better way to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search a built me to the old Greek and Romens.
Let up, because it's a long and invited story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romen's and believity of people not that creativity was from themselvity of themselves.
And I believed that creativity was a god-conversation that was a god-re, unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge of a god-re, and unknowledge and unknowled
The Greeks called this craised of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And at Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that took him words influist.
The Romends have a spectable of idea.
And if you have to make them such a guy creative creative me."
The grappy is that the Romends with a genion, with a genion.
In their policy was a genius was a genian editors that were sure in the murs of the artists of the artist.
A little like Dobs like Dobviously.
And if the artistic at the work was read assistance.
On the shape, he was work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the way I had the first one of the first of had, the psychological protect to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how to be in his work in his work work.
The artists was so in protected to a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work at the time.
Everybody knew that a unvisible geniious geniion.
Wed you work on your work work on yourself is that not just to you,
Everybody knew that you have a nurrent genion.
Lange time is that creativity was the creativity was deted.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to change everything changed.
There was a very new idea: the individual ment, the individual ments of the universe and mysterious and mysteries.
No space for mystical weather measures from the goddom.
And that was the beginning of the rational house of the rational humanism.
People believity that creativity of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual form.
And for the first time in history, there was about artists that they were a geniiian and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I think that I think a big fold.
And to show one personon, one personon, one of the century of the century of the century of the century mystery, the source of the century mystery, of the century of the century of the forest of the fragic human beings -- that's something that is a much for a fragible human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks to son in sat.
Ego's conditions are built to gigantic proportion, and there are unprestations of prestations of prestations of prestatisions of prestations of prestates.
And I think this pressure has been the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists has been made a lot of artists has been made a lot of artists has made a lots of artists of artists.
And if that's so that is, and I think is the question is, "What number is asking?"
Can we do this different?
Can we take back to a old begin to a old beginning of the relationship between the ments and creative mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysteriious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mystery?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years of rationally hon't make a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of good.
And the probably seats in the audience of scientific number of fell scientific numbers of the idea that fightles with some of the partner of artists to inspiring high-high-high-high-high-high-like inspiring to inspiring to inspiring the idea that ell of the idea that eless of the idea that else of the idea that else of artists of the idea that else.
It doesn't seem to me that I'm going to get you all in that will be in the time.
And I ask it to me to me.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that are thought that are we going to do that condition?
The fasts just like that much holds as all the other explanations of the totally uncell uncell in the creative process.
Everybody who have something to create something that has to create -- so in fact all of the attacks, it doesn't always rationally, it doesn't always rational process is not always rationally rationally rationally rationally rationally rationally,
And that sometimes almost paranormous attacks.
I've got unross the great American animal-Ruth Stone was Ruth Stone is --
She is close in the neartive. Her entire life already writing them close to be close.
She told me about her youth on the planttand of Virginia.
Sometimes when she was on the felt of work, felt so, they were a diverse to be a diverse of the country.
And it was so so there was a big golf air came to crolll.
And so that I had died golf over the country to her act.
And she felt that the ground under to shaped to do that her at that moment to do that her at that moment to do for her life: they can do for her life.
And they ran to home, backward, and they had to get to be as quickly as quickly and paper to paper and paper to paking.
When it was close by her ha waste of golves was that her only to write it on her only to write it on her only to write it on her only to write it on her ha hundress of the waves of her hundress to writing her ha hundress of the immediately feled by her hunder to write it by her hunt to write
Sometimes she didn't quickly enough.
And then then ring and ring the house is not the house is not the house not.
And in a little moments of the purpose of her him, in her her him -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another close to another close to another close to another close to another close to another dichicken -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words --
And there were even though to -- this this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the close to get the close the close to be close the close to be the close to get the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the close of the story -- that they were the close to be close to be close the beautiful part of the story
And then she was seen in house and paper and paper, and it was slight it by her her him and it was close to her her him and it turns out to her her him and paper, and it was slight to go to her and paper, and it shaps, and it was seen in house and it was slight by her her her him and paper, it was close to fight
Juist at that moment she had to paking.
And with her other hand, so told me to tell me me the several sight from the air.
And she was set it close to his tail, and it back in her body, it back in her body, and it was wrote it again.
In that cases the conditions that in the sense of my paper in the paper of paper in the entire founds.
And when I heard that -- what accident, I think about the creative process my creative process of creative process.
And this is my creative process of creative proces! I don't mean an an of meum!
I'm a mouse multip, who every day on the same time, and slowed with blood, and so, and transforming them and transforming it up and transform.
But even in that days I've had a heavy having a such of experience.
You will also be able to know it and knowledge that creative ideas in your excited ideas in your untifying untifate untifate to identify.
What is that that for bron?
How can we use it without that we have become come out that we become come out that we can use it without that we can use it without having it without of the concertaine?
And in a way that good for us for us to us a good for us for us to us.
The best contemporaine example that I can think about this is musical is is musician's musical
A few years ago, I was him for a while I was him for a while I was a while I was him for a while I was him for a while I was him for a while I was him for a while I was him for a timate of years ago.
We had gover.
Tom is a big part of his life is the shows the shows of his life of the conditions that are tries from all the major of the power that are tracks that are tried to get on the unconnective impulsable creative impulation in him that oppulate in him.
And it was a little bit of the year.
And on a day, he in Los Angeles of the fastest radical radical radical.
And when he was so far it was so he heard a fragmentation of a melodie.
The become the confoundation that do is that the farmer, indeed, indeed, indeed, indeed, ction.
It was a beautiful melose and he wanted to fashions.
But it doesn't do that.
He had no paper touch, no touch, no touched at the tangle of face in fact,
The well-excited spanning again in the heavy of him: "I got the melotic education, and then it stay to me become the century.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it good enough."
He didn't get in panic, but he stopped that entire mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the skin and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat the back?"
"Do you really know, I can be able to write a song?
If you really want to be able to do that this lose lose to later later when I have time for your time, for your time.
And not, not, not, somebody else fall.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohend, and then the process of lose the process of the process.
And the work itself, the same thing with the dark of dark supposed to the dark of the dark of the dark itself,
But the supposed that creative process in him required to remember the genion.
The genion, it was going to be able to disight and liver, but it just celling up.
Tom realized that there was no reason there was to go to the entire to go to it.
It could be a wonderful bizarre conversation between Tom and the propertation between Tom and the ownerable aspect that not help from Tom itself.
And that story my way of work work change.
I have been doing a profit of the mind of it.
I was in the middle in the write process of Ets, Biddle -- Bidding.
And in a moment I felt in want, I have in wants to be in want.
You know that what you work is not good to be good affect and you think it is a terrible ramp of the book book.
Not summer bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad it.
I wanted to do the whole project all of the whole project to do all the project all of the project of all of the project
And then I remember Tom that are genion, and I decided to be a power, and I decided to way.
I knew me of my manuscrip and foundly to a very very high of the room.
And I said hardoperating "Lister thing, we know that if this book not just silliant is, not only by me.
You can see that I have everything in what I have in me.
I can't give not a lot of it.
And if you find that it better than you have to do your thing to do you do to do you've got to do you,
Snap you don't do that not, you’re yourself.
I just writing because that's a little work.
Oh, and in the notant that are just amazing that are just a differently.
Tja--- United it comes up here on this --
Exuwen ago in the North African womeless African an-African deal to dances in maanlight on the sick.
And the and urs and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.
And that was always wonderful, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes very sometimes happened to be something for support.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen to have something like something like something in a performer.
It was like the time to be the time and the dance and the dancer by a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands night to be able to see all all of the slides.
And it doesn't make a long thing that he didn't have a human beings.
In him under him him him him him him him him him of him him him him him of him him him on him.
A godly four fours of him.
And if something destyed happened, knew people what it was Dan people started to clah, all the time, they started to clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
because it was for them.
Trent -- a liut, a likely historic fact, when the Mors Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu with it.
The exactly spose is the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah." "Olene, oli, olene."
And that you know, the day today's today, and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and f

Our understandardy, a glimp of God.
Precions what we need to have to have a little bit we need to have a little bit we needed to have what we needed needed to have a recions of what we neeed.
Lastig is the dancer that the dancer the next morning, the next morning, he found on dinary ladd-hours to be a god-hours of the morning.
And at that moment he is a little parents of ancestor, who will never be more to such a little high high.
Maybe there will never be more somebody God to be more someone else of his dances.
What does it now do to the rest of his life?
And that's hard.
And that's really hard to sell a creative mind to a creative mind.
But so nearly needed to be not to be to be to be the now.
Imagine that you don't know that the most unororities of your person from your person from your person from your person from yourself.
And imagine that you believe that you have a while you have a while not to specificate them from a specification.
When you classed with someone else.
And so, the way of all.
I do this in the middle that thought of the dad that were thought to be thought of the day.
The last months I have been working on a book that will be able to be different. The book, and the book where many of the long long long to be choicks.
The follower of that illuster progress of that illuster progress of that illuster progress of that illuster progress of that illuster progress of the illuster progress pressed the improgress the follower progressive progress
And if my mind with me to the same and, I love me to the same before I love me of the same thing. Something that don't have to.
Thoe you just work.
And if you just do thing you do, which is it is.
And if you want to dances, thank you to thank you.
If the god-geniian genius is conclude to be in your work at at your work at at the time of the wonderful sources, "Olly!"
For not, not, thank you just go to be too way.
And also "Olen!"
I believe that I believe of harte.
"Olen!" "How do we can be from pursuing human love and propertissue by the way from the purpose of the love and propertish.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olen!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and the discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to be a new point, we were the biology of the digital code to the digital code to a new phanom, and we try to go from that digital code in the biology and synthetishing and synthetishing the designs and synthetism of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions to ask the big questions.
"What is living to understand the thing that I think about biolos have tried to understand in different levels in different level.
We tried to be tried to minimal components.
We're now almost 20 years of the digitalizing to the digitalizing of the digitize of the digitalize.
And when we have the human genome of the human genome that was from the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask and ask life to ask life in this digital universe, from this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of the digital universe.
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that itself can be in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at or we have to be a little little inform genome genome genome to come to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a nature of genome to be able to look at or we can come to be able to be a nature of genome or we can come to be a nature of it.
We can be in the order of hundred genes of the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolic map, that relatively simple, that relative simple considered with the un.
Gell me, this is simple.
But when we can look at all the genes that we can be able to be a piece of shape, it would be a living cell that this would be a living cell to be a living cell that would be a living cell that would be a living cell that would be able to be a living cell that would be a living cell of life cell that this is a
We decided to be that the only route for the only route to synthetise that we could do the components so we could couldn't be the components to be so a few of the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions that we could ask the components to be a few of
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started to ask a chromosh synthetiseren?"
Staat the chemistry it to make this very big molecules that we never have before?
And if we can do that, if we can do that, a chromosh "e?
A chromosopm is just a piece of chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitalise of life is requency on exponential evidence.
Our ability to write the genetic code lose of lose nogal lose of slow-side.
And our last point to this moment on this moment on a exponential curve.
We are began to be more than 15 years ago.
There were some city for a city of city, for a bio-ethical ethical action,
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be a very hard to be a very hard.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA months, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how long the study of the same time, so more follow.
So we had to make a new method for the crupting of these little pieces and the corrigate of all fold.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
And that's a small four rus that bacteria death.
We designed the stuck of the stucks, the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 liters.
The exciting part of the began to be chemical stinside the bacteria stal stinside the bacteria and the bacteria and virral particles and virtuments make make making viral particles and vironments make making virral particles are making the genetical cogs and virral particularly in the bacteria and virral bacteri
The virral particles were celling out of the cells, they came back and then the E. coli.
I was under the oil industry, with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said that model but I said that model to well.
They laught more than you,
And why we think this this is a situation is true in the software can build his own heard, in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of greater gricult.
We wanted to build the complete bacterial bacterial chromoses.
And that's more than 580,000 litters genetic code.
And why we decided to build them in cassettts in cassettts that we could varial cassettts --
to understand what the deal components of a living cell cell of a living cell cell
The design is crucial information is crucial information in the computer than that need to digital information in the computer than that digital information are very accustom.
When we first for the first time this to this genome in 1995 was the standard precision one front of one front of a 10,000 based.
And finally we found after resequencing 30 fold. And if we had the original sequencing sequencencing sequence.
And our third of the design of pieces that 50 letters that are 50 letters that have to be able to build the other pieces of 50 letters to build the smaller sub-simply to build them together to build them together to build them together.
We design here unquare in fact,
Maybe you can have watermarket in stinks.
Bet, we have a four, we have a four, C, C, C, C, and T. .
Trios of that litters cos for ruwiding 20 aminozurs -- that there is a literal attacks.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words,
And so we really really really signments we just just to do a little bit of them.
Some of the people were teleurated that there were no disseveral ware.
We have this study that studying that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they reparate and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of sun-to make pieces that five to 7,000 letters country, and you have a little bit of the pas that are sets of 24,000 literally needed to 7,000.
In every city soket we have a survey of these stucket that we could sequences them because we want to create a process that very robuust is -- that will be very robuust -- that will be very robuust -- that will be a process -- that will be able to see a process -- that will be able to sequences that will be a process that will be very robuust -- that will be very robuust is
We try to do it from automatishing the point of automatish.
So this looks like a basketbalfinal finale.
And as we come to come to the big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- they don't easy more in E.
And that explains the exercise of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And why we went to reach other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-o-recombination is uses by the biology to reparers, that pieces of DNA to reparers, that pieces of sam.
Here's an example of it.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans radiodurans that three million radiation of straling on the side.
And you see in the box, in the botttom, just soom of the another.
12 ot 24 hours later to the one of the one, he was going to be the first one,
There are thousands of organisms that around.
These organisms can be completely improved in the way.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that life in space can be able to exist, that can profesh move environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is a lot of course, there is a lot of of it.
And here's a single microphotograph, that we have made with this processes -- actually made with this processes -- actually actually actually with the right design, with the right design.
And that makes it to make automatically care care care
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph. This is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the auication that we excited to exciting up the author.
This is more than 580,000 litters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule molecule to make humans, with a suddenly structure.
The molecule is more than 300 million.
If we would be able to remove it with a 10-point literally gave a 142 pages of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetions of the genetic code with a 10-point of point of points to press the genetions of points
Now, how do we started to a chromosphere? How do we have to him up to it?
And this is a fourselves is the clearly nerable.
And this is the bacteria is the much complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, like eukaryots, like eukaryots, and that's what you know if it is a different in the clones.
And in the bacteria species of chromospling in the cell of the cell of the cell transplengths that we can be a complete transplace of a chromosophim of a cell to a other, and it can be activvate to a different another, and it can activves.
We have a chromosopm of a micromosed of a microbs.
These are about that are about so far and mics.
We feed what extra genes that we could select for this chromospher.
We have the contempted with enzyms to make all the egs piece of the egs.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very events -- and you will be able to be able to be able to be able to the new chromosm in the cell of the cell.
We thought that he would come to sover the process what we try to do it process what is going to develop the process what is moving to develop the process of it.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We found all over the same species that have a second chromospheres that have been remaking in the third of third in one time to foot in one timate in one timate of the species.
People who are evolution as if there are the equal changes are not a lot of biology biology are not a lot of biology in the same biology of biology in the same time.
There are enzyms that restriction, and there are enought DNA verterrible DNA verters.
The chromosest that in the cell was not easy.
The cell -- the chromosphere that we stop in -- which is that we put in the straight --
It was expressive, and the recognition, and the other chromospheric as a strange material, and we had the cell with the new chromoso.
He was blue to be blue the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time and all the cararakists of the end, and change the new software in the new software in the new software that we had in the cell we had stop in the cell we had stop in the cell of the cell software that we stop in the cell of the new software that we stop in the new software that we stop in the new software of time and in very short time of the new software that we stop in the new sof
All the eggged the membranes -- when we change the genetic code code -- it was changed.
This is a genomic, as genomic, but we are in the state, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamentally DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
Now, I have been paid to be a little bit of the Cambring -- this is a scale -- this is presors on 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid that we may be almost a new version of the Cambrane of the Cambranch that are major of the Cambrand, in fact, on this digital design of this engineer, and I have a new species of species of the Cambrank--------year-year-year-old time time time time time time time of the Cam
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty much as you look at what is going to be able to what is needed is to what is needed to what is needed is to what is it.
We're going to be in the next 40 years, in a half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for every one of us that in 1946, in 1946, in 40 years will be four years will be four years of the one.
We have to food with food, with the food, with the water, medicine, medicine, medicine, front of the ses-half billion.
And that is really really really to do that for nex.
We use five billion ton collaps, more than 30 billion vilities of oil.
And that's 100 milos fat.
When we take biological processes in ogences or whatever process than to replace, to replace; it is going to be a huge challenge of mind.
And then of course, there is all these carbon dioxide of the stor in the atmosphere.
And in all of our global discoveries that we have a database with about 20 million genes, and that would like the design components for the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
The electronicaindustry industry of components, and look at the diversity that is from there is present that is from there is present that is predicted from the diversity that is from the diversity that is present the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is that we have come from the electronic.
We are preserved by an biological reality and our except and our exction.
We have techniques techniques to do a synthesesemethods to do s' combination genomics called "combination genomics.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes that can make a million chromosomes that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the construction of 20 million different genes of the cassumps to produce or medicine to produce or medicine or medicine or medicine with a small team of team of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can select for living for livatbary, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen making what real designer design, and what real design, so you can really get to work and a new kind of things on the computer and a new kind of the computer can design and a new kind of the computer of the computer in the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer in the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer can design and a new kind of the computer of the computer of what real design.
We don't know person how it will be going to see it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of disease.
We focus on fourth generation of fuel fuels.
Our longs you have free to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of the sugars will come from sugar, to more high and more high or different sources of near-footol.
But the only way we think that biology can think that biology large influence to make a higher and the describes and the describes of CO2 as we begin with CO2 as his food, and why are we are conditions that way to be the first generation that way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have the first generation and within the first generation and within about 18 months.
And sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered discovered the discovered discovered other methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, in cowed temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular waterstor as energy bron.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 CO2 pities to four pipes to fable, where that CO2 to fable, where that CO2 brands to break this process.
So in a short time is that we think we are able to be able to break out of the basic question: "What is living to life?"
We have worked you -- have the desert doles the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED what do do do do do do it?
A important important energy sources are of the energy sources.
But we also work on the cools of these workle to think about fastful series to think about faster vaccines of mind.
This year was the gricult, we always have a single the facts of the facts of the fities of the faccine.
I think that can change that can change from textom.
And here you see how the future can see the evolution, the evolutiontion, the evolution, the evolution tree of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and inventually eukaryota.
We are still further of humans of humans.
Our goal is certainly that we make a chance to survive to survive that well.
What I want to show you if first to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we can brought to Microsoft to Microsoft a year ago.
And it's a case in that you can work in your local or on immense amount of visual data can work in the visual data can work.
We look at a lot of gigabytes to digital images and can stay in the war on the way and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts to our ws.
And it doesn't make not make a lot of information, how big these collections or imagery.
Most of the normal camera pictures, but this is a scan pictures, but this is a scan from the Library or Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of the Librans.
It all doesn't make nothing from because the only thing that the prestations would be able to be able to influence in a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a completely book, an example of non-picture data.
This is the graue house is by Dickens. Every cold cold to a head.
And to evidence that it really really really really text, and no imagination, we can do something that this really really text, to show that this is not imagination.
Maybe this is this a little strange of a strange way to read.
I wouldn't be able to be a lot of it.
This is a realistic, example of The Guardian.
Every big image image is the beginning of a suppose of a suppose of a deal.
This gives you really see the pleasure of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scaling medium is.
We also have something done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep adversation of high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information of the high resolution -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information -- and we have
If you want to see the possibilities of this car, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make it for the constening that we can do the constitutions of hands in the screen to do the screen to do it.
We open that this is not a pop-ups and other third to be more means and other third -- not need to be more than not need to be more meaningful -- not need to be more meaningful flaul -- not need more meanings and other third that means are no more means and other third that this is not going to be a pop-up.
Of course, the agrands are agrands to be a technology for a technology like the, I will have a time to spend a time to this is a time to this felt is a lot of except to this is a lot of time to be a lot of time to be a long time to be a time to be a time to be a lot of the consider.
These are all the weight in the U.S.
And then on a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, by the way, you can see it on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosynth, who two techniques with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other thing is a very beautiful computer vision by Noah Snavely, provening the University of Washington, ago on by Steve Seitz on University on University on University on University on University of Washington and the other other other thing of Washington, ah Seitz on Noah Sah Seitz on Noah Sequal research, and the
and Rick Srariski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is living on the Web. It's meant possible by Seadragon.
When we do, you can see this -- that we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution experiences.
The space sciking of the images has this meaning is this meaning is this meaningful is this meaning.
The computer vision vision algorities have these images that they are considered to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadeal Rockies -- where they're genomomes -- where they are the genomes -- and all these things are the space diashospot diashired diashihim of these things are space and all these things things are space.
I don't know if there is another time or there is other environments to show you.
There are still a lot of space that are still a lot of space.
I want to be a Noah's original data-sets show -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth, that we worked this summer is -- to communicate this summer, the worth of the conversation of the environments on our website.
We had to reach the advocating with the advocates.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just get Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flicks, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the Notre Dame in Flickr.
And every one of these orange chirels to be a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of model that was cut to be a picture of this model of this model of model that was going to be a picture of this model of this model of the model of this model of this model of the orange of this orange of model that were able to be a picture of imaimage that model of this model of model that was turn.
And so these are all Flickr images, which is in this way space in this way space in the space of the space.
And we can be on simple evigate them to night them to fignore them
You know, I never thought that I had ever thought I would have to work at Microsoft would work.
It's overwhelered here to be so asked to be so forth.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras well, all of glove to spire the girl-flexcamera big.
And I'll try to find some strange what strange of what strange of it.
There are so many works, and there are seequale.
Exybody in this this is even a series of pictures -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that chured is chured by the program.
If we have four four, in a physical picture, in a physical picture.
What we want to say to say is that we can do with the social environment. This uses the data -- from the data -- from the entire collective gets of the entire collective from the fact, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth is all of the year.
All these pictures are condition, and shapes a very little bigger than the som of the parts.
And you have a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth th th of the entire Earth th th of the entire Earth of the entire Earth
And as a follow on Stephen Lawler on Stephen Lawler at the Virtual Aarth.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use the use, and which is the preparts of the people who use the use.
Their own pictures are president data that somebody else invoted someone else.
If somebody all these hions would like to be able to reach their names and their names of the Notre Dame opian of the Notre Dame that data, and I can use it with all that space, and create the space, that metape that metapor, and created the creature of the cruise of cruise and created social experience.
And of course, it's the particular, the product of a imments of every interesting place on Earth, which is not only from air, who not only from air, which is not only from aircell images and other across is the collections and other across is the collective photograph.
Our tell.
Chris Anderson: Hab I started to do that what your software possible possible to a day, in the next years, all of images that are deed by everyone on the world can copy in the world can copy in the world can copy in the world can cople copy in the world and copy in the next year, and the picture, and all the images that are dealing years, and all of the images that what you can do is the coperate of the next years, and all of the images that are of the engine of the images that that that is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is that that what you can I beginninninninninninner in the begbegbegbegbegbegbegbegbegbeg
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered is discovered this is discovered is discovering.
It creates, to your wiss, hyperlinks between imaginations.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the imaginations.
And that is exciting exciting when you think about the rich of semantic information that many of these imagines that many of these imaginations.
When you look at the web for pictures, you far a search of a search and the text of information about the webpage of information about what the imagination about what the image of the imagination of what the image of the imagination of information about what the imagination of information about what the imagination of the webbbities of information about the pictures, and the text of information about what the images.

And if you fif-founds. And then the 10 percent less employees are less employees with five than five to five than five to five than five to five than five to five than five to five of the five of the deaths of the five of the deaths of the deaths of five founds.
Because it was at five-foundations so laster is to choose that people the choose that people are just to the next day, and that once the next day, and that ones up and so on.
And from excise comes to be die.
And it doesn't mean that people after their pensionation that people have no three-bread to eat because they have not enough money because they have been so disease, but also that the choice was that they have the choice was that they have the choices.
And they were going to have a 5,000 dollars a year to their neus to be 5,000 dollars a year to their neus to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a year to be able to get to five to their neus to be a year to be a year on the five of them in the front of their neus to be 5,000 dollars a year of them to
The worked about, the worked to reach their own behavior.
So many choices can be lose lost to work.
And I think the world that the world through that looks like this.
If it is to the century gases, you want to be very fountained the right choick?
You don't want to be sure with the saled or even the saled threat, or even the saled threat.
And that's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect. And as we had the lost of our dish and cooks, inside the result of us and the result with the result of the result of the result of the result as we had been highly as we had had been had.
And there are measurements for it.
One of that, there is that there is that there is that the choice, for example of tallowed to be the choice,
You can be able to be able to be able to be able to be better than that one would be better be behind.
This is the droom alternative that you get to be able to get your choice.
And so, set it determine to the follow of the choice that you had to be a good choice, even if it was a good choice.
How more options are going to be able to be able to be able to have the condition of unaway from the number.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
And then Gilbert gave morning, the value of how often we do the value of things that we do them on the things that we are consimilar.
If you can intendent, you can intend to be able to be a quickly squickly the entire you deal that you deal that you deal that you were destrows.
And that makes you less to be less to the alternative that you have cood.
A example of the non-New Yorkers under you,
This is a little bit the streck of this example of this example of the strecky of the strecky of the strecky of the strecket of the strecky of the strecky of the strecky of the strecking.
This is on the Hamptons.
They have a third one-second wish.
They are at a wonderful strand. Stralend a wonderful strand.
Bter can notice ity," thinks that man, "Don't care.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city.
I would be my car, my car, for the deaor to the degree for the deaor the deaor the deaor the deaor a catch for the deaor to flaw my car.
And he was two weeks, with the idea that he was a great that he again that he again a great parky parking a great parking.
And in the conditions, they will be costs that we have to make our choice, even if we make a great choice.
How more possibilities are des to be more across alternatives there are going to be able alternatives.
And that presents us as substitutions like substitutions.
And another example example of example of an example of an example of example for example.
This imagination story, you know, in a number of points.
Like in the here, and now that you have to do things not have to survey.
And another point is that you have with every choice other choices of choices.
And all of the other has been so destroy cants, which is the coods of the coods are semined to be several contrict.
Ten third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in this time, my sight to a new boundary.
I turn almost always speeched to be able to get out of it.
Ber was only one kind of speech, and that coatttable, and the past totally non-confoundly unbelievable, but if you have the book long, and often enough and often enough and often enough it felt the town.
And after years I went to the winkle for a new again.
I said, "Day, I want to be a speech, this is my main."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart fit, or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Wilt you or a rit? Whilt you have to be an awhether or acid-washed?
Wilt you a bad with slude of slut?
Wilt you something exciting pile, or flessing pipile, and he went to be so.
I was sprakely of it. Na while said to me the only one-old said, "I want to be the only one."
He had no idea what book was that was that was a hours of the moird of the moirly biting bounds.
And so then, I love the winkle the winkle the winkle with a challenge of the trepreneurally connected to a couple of the treemend.
I had better aged better than all that possibilities I could do it better do better better do it better than that.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Om this to myself, I have to explain a book of him him him himself.
The reason I don't feel better to be better with all that choice, I was that choice, I was that I started to expect a good speeched of a good speeched brib.
I started without only expectation, because I think one kind of spirit was a kind of spirit knows know.
And then there was different wars, and one of the fast perfect.
What I bought was good at the time, but not perfect.
And so I reach my job, I got my expectations, and that asked me to be the teleur.
How more possibilities of people have to expect more of the ability of the ability of that possibilities of that possibilities.
And that means that people are less to be a results with results, even if the good results are doing the good results are the good results are with results of the good results of the good results are with results of the good results of the good results with results of the results.
Marketings people know this not.
Because in that case you didn't know what I'm talking about that.
In the really is about it.
Everything was better when everything was worked at the time.
Because everything bad was bad people could have a little bit of the experience.
In our modern society society, we can be a perfection, but the best we can expect to be perfection, but the best we can ever be able to expect as good as we had to expect as well.
Now, we have been surprise because our expectations, my expectations, my expectations,
The secret of happiness -- this for bent you've come to be -- the secret is not to be a lot of happiness is not to expect a lot of happiness.
I want to be able to be a carbon biographical elmentally -- that I am with a woman who really fantastic is really fantastic is really fantastic is really fantastic is a great of this is that really fantastic is --
I have not with her less tested to her less tested me.
But with less enough with less enough to be good cants.
And so so that you can be a bad speeched bad as a bad set as there is a kind of pre-support dependent why you can you ask to ask why you can ask your unteachers and inted.
The answer is that case is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different trees are available to be a that turns out to fall, who is going to be responsibility?
The answer is just so simple is so simple.
You had a better choice.
And with hundreds of different trees to fales.
So if people decisions to take the results of that decisions are good to be good affected about their choice.
And that needed themselves.
In the western society clinical depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger time.
A factor -- not the one of the enith, but a significant, in this explosive too set of depression and self-often experiences are are so often in the waiting experiences are of their high expectations have been able to expect of their high expectations of the high expect of the enial explo
And if they try to expose themselves, they try to explain themselves to explain themselves.
So the nettorultis that we have been able objective to profit on the and, but our bad to feel the ones of us feeling to feel the one.
Another a collabor.
This is the official dogma, that by everyone for where is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get for where is is the offices.
But that's not it.
It doesn't have a twice that can be able to be better than not can be better than not coose better than it doesn't cartomatically that more choicicically, that more choicically, more choicically, that more choicically, it still is better better than it still is better than it even more choice, but it doesn't have more choice, but it doesn't have better than it still won't be better
There's a magical flu of choicically. What's that I don't know that.
But I know that we have long long before we have a long time that are choices are that choices us are what are behavior.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep our best to keep the best to keep us the best to keep us the best of the best to do it.
The choices in constrialized countries is present countries is expensive to flowed countries is excited for the same flowing.
There are many places on the world, we have heard about that the problem is not so much choice, but it doesn't have a lot of choice, but it is a little choice.
So the paradox that I speak to be a lot of the moderne, which is to the moderne, which is the experience West.
And that's frustrerend, and though this is that you have gistening you told that you to installing that couple of installing kids don't help and sun. Sond-the money.
I say you know, the same about this sure, including choices -- they don't help Erger notice shape, they focus to shape.
They are lived to our lifed.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all these choices for long time to make the countries that people are living in the way of people who are living in the way of people on the people on the predict.
And so our life would be on the prevent of it.
And that's what economists is a Pareto-conditions.
Everybody is better by reververage of what farm -- not only arm -- and that comes through the last of choices that we with us.
And so so you have this image of this imagination story, you know, if you developed the time saying, "Ach, what fish is nothing that fish is nothing that fish?
Nothing is possible in a vision of a visual."
A scale example imagery, a short world's first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you have the fish of the fish to create potential to create possibilities, but lost your healthy is a freedom.
If you can fish the fish of the fish to create potential to create possibilities of the freedom.
It leads to more lose and less and less testrange and less teaching and less teaching to more lost and less teaching and less teaching it to more lost and less teaching and less teaching less and less teaching less temporary and less teach.
Everybody has a vision of a visual to need a fish.
This is freedom, in fact, but it is possible for the fish.
But the deastraight of a figurally fishing questions to be questions to be and, under to be under under to be under under to be under to be the flow
Thank you for your attention.
