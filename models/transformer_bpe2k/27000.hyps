Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the Poy cap, who had the past three million years of the major had been the size of the U.S.
But this is actually the nice of this specific problem because it doesn't show the divide of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice-catch problem.
The ice skap on the North Pole, in a way, sheart of our global climate system.
It turns out in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a conclude version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is purpose of the premanently in red.
As you see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the annual ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called permanent, five years or older, or older, is almost like blood, that from the body.
In 25 years of this is going to go to this pink in 25 years of this one.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the Northern Iceless warms, and there is a very big amount of frozen woman, and there's a very big amount of carbon is dying, by microbes in methane.
And read the total amount of disconclude in the atmosphere, that could be doubled that can doubles if we describe the amount of the atmosphere.
In some indeep indeep in Alaska signrelies methane in the water.
And the last winter went to Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another one.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is right.
A reason for that, is that this huge "warm-widing Groenland from the north of warms.
This is a melectwo-free revier.
The water volume is bigger than echer than eat.
This is the Kanger-lussian reeful in South Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea single style is because the landy melt, then this is the place where it comes into the sea.
These are taking stroms.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, inventing the size mass on ice mass on ice the Earth.
And the last months reported scientists scientists that the entire continent now,
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly about the melt, with some of the underwatering of the underwaters.
The whole continent is to six meter sea squire stying, just like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the biggest ice mass, are now new now, who were still glaciers were still glaciers were still glaciers
40 percent of the world's population is half of his drinkwater is taking water of meltic water.
In the Anthen, is this glestjer the source of drinkwater for this city.
There are more strops.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California was a reduction of 40 percent in the snowpak of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are nest at the time.
This global dreamed dream read to a dramatical stying,
And the number of nature, the number of course, and the ingely and never seen a pipal and never seen speed.
Four time time in the last 30 years, in the prevented 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping intention,
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 feet every 24 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, every day in our oceans, look at the east area of the Stille of the Stille of the Indian subcontinent, and at each of the Indian subcontinent, there's a behavior in the ocean in the oceans.
The only big cause of the global warming warming the Earth, which is to deforestation, is for 20 percent of the global fuels of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and coal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extincludes with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coalain't going to build a lot more coal-coal-coal-making centrales.
But we see a cirmess.
These are the coales of which the bites of which the bital coal-past year-old alternatives were alternatives were represented in the last year.
There's a political streedom of political streedom in our country.
The coal carbon -- and oil industry gave last year, 250 million dollars of the class' coal coal of coal coal coal of device.
And that picture was doing something about something like this.
And the guy was at home in Tennessee, about four billion literally croches modle of gallon mod.
You probably seen it in the news of news.
This is the biggest flow in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cookoolines of the colinlined Cerstonish.
Video: ""Frosty the stey carbon man is a key call.
He's overliquid away here in America, and he causes in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coal carbon man is scannound.
He's paid and cute employees and employees their job."
Here's a big part of the coal chool in West Virginia.
The biggest mines of the country is the big batches of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwship of the Let me become supposed to be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate.
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Video "Bue COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
And that's why the reason is why the most important goal is to give a giant containing to the light of the light and bring the light and the departners.
Fit is, stead, and coal is not smart.
We find that it's snow, -- and it still wrong -- and it still wrong.
So, you don't make worry about climate change change
Let me talk about us.
Video: Schone coal coal, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shows up with this hyper-carbon carbon centrale.
Fantastic! The machines make pretty a little bit of lay --
But that's the sound of clean coal-coal technology.
Despite the fact that the breaths of steengths of the main causes of warming the global warming of the Earth, the remarkable shopping of the grid of a lot of shapes that you see all here.
Look at the same time, this is the showed cools of today.
Al Gore: Einventually, the positive alternative at our economic challenges, and that on the area of national security.
Video: Stem: America wrong in crisis, the national security of the national security crisis.
The red rate in all of these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel of fuel of fuel and impacts and imported oil.
But now there's a during new solution to get out of this.
And front of 100 percent of clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to work on the work of a plan that makes us safer and the warming of the Earth to.
And inally, a solution that requires is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Repower America.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's about re-America power.
One of the quickest ways to make an endless of our dependence of old old burnness of old fuels that our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, Wind, sun, a new energy system.
And they are going to be able to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speakword that says, "If you want to be fast as you want to be all of it.
If you want to go far with it, you know,
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called a update about how this machine works.
So I am here for those who didn't waren: The LHC is the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever underneath in bomb.
It has to be the circumstances that were attacked less than a billion, after the universe started to be a billion.
Enorm ambitius, s!
This is the machine of Genee;
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one where I work. It's called ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in attacular so you can see the scale.
At 10 seppear of the first time we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
And that causes a partment in the control room.
It's a photograph of the first particle that was all around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is a piece of the LHC, which is a piece of the detector flowed with a piece of the first particles of the first particles of the first particular particles.
In other words, when we saw that picture at 10 September of the first work, we knew that the machine works, which is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the biggest across or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page of it was so out of business that looked like this.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we made a scientific impact of a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we made a kind of a scientific impact a kind of a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which was doing with these golden draming.
And they were 13 thousand clived 13 thousand calling the enge of enough work.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they are superagoidend at very low temperature and
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, that can be flowing the flow of the stars, that flow that flow up to the behaviors that flow up in the well.
In one of the connections between the nine of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive in the LHC, was a constructive false.
And then the wire was wire something warmer, and it was incentive against that 13 thousand ample of coopers.
This was the result.
This is still inpressure if you realized that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of road, and they were about 30 inches were moved.
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We were saved them.
Now they are back on road.
Eind mands will be against intact.
We'll put it back back and we expect it against and we expect to figure out what the building and we can go and expect to figure out what the building of the universe of the universe of the universe are building and we expect it again.
Now, of course, they have sounces the reincidents the value of scientific research of scientific research.
I think it's a fact that it's so hard to be more difficult than the fact that we go beyond the LHC. C.
I let the last words on the English scientist Humphany-No, I had to do the deavy, I had to define the value of his teachers of his teachers of his teacher was Michael Farase, "None, is a dangerous for the progress, and the progress, and we have no discuss of science of human mines are not a mysteries in the other thing that are not a new world of the world's science of nature, and that there are no new world."
Thank you.
I would like to start to start to ask back to your children's time when you play with blocks.
When you discovered how to grab to grab them up and conscious, and you were actually problems to solve with the teaching of the connection with and hands of space relationship of relationship to reach and hands of space relationship to deal with it, and you know, they were going to have to deal with it, and you know, the other thing you had to grab to grab with it.
Ruimtely insight is amazing destroy with understanding the world to us.
If an information inspired by the nut of physical interaction with objects -- with objects -- with objects -- with my adviser Pattion and my fish -- I started asking to ask -- what if we use a computer -- what if we use a computer -- what if we use a computer -- what if we use a computer that one kind of digital finger education that moves on a plate of digital finger information with the information of the insive information that would be degree with both information
and ordering the way we want?
And these question, that we decided that we decided to look at an answer by seeing Siftables.
Sort conclump is a Siftable computer in a cooky.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel together and they can feel their movement and they contain and they contain and they contain and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands of blocks as blocks can they get to graduate by grabbed to graduate it.
And the other thing disaptables are an example of a new new ecosystem for ways of digital information.
And that these helping tools have a more physical different, are aware of their movement and each other, and even of the way we move them to discover and fun interactions of discovering and fun interactions of discovering them are different new and fun interactions of the way we are moving and fun interactions are aware of their movement and
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instoned to tell a video that you can could, which is play and others and others differently.
These interactive portraits of each other.
Indians next to each other, they will be interest to each other.
If they are surround, they can also do this and what can be become some nervous about become a little bit of nervous weak and become a little bit of nervous and what nervous about it.
And they feel movement and shelling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all the interesting of the interaction, as it excise of a color as it was a listening color as it was a liististo.
In this example three Siftables lesson and I can use them to go and use them to go color in a very very much, where they are becoming a very very much.
If we have done threat, we went back to what we went back back to that.
There are some of the city of critical cropes for education, mathematics and mathematics and logic where we want to give people the possibility and the result of these things quickly immediately, and the result immediately.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci by a simple computation programatic computation programatic response of a calculator.
And here we show a game that is a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter to get around a willing letter on every Siftable, and then control in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it's very rescued and appeard, and appears a new series of letters with behind possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I became it out to make them out and make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this approximation is that people don't need instructions of people need.
All you have to say is "Most word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here's some other people test the tests.
That's our youngest ber bree-ster at the right.
And it takes only the Siftables left the Siftables of the Siftables of the Siftables of the Siftables of wall.
For him these were just blocks.
Here's an interactive paintingly painted paint.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language of language
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new characterters in the scene of the Siftable with that caracter's Siftable with that carried the table.
Here's the Sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the tractor in the scene of the tractor in the scene of the scene of the tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
God dy! Yeah!
And by the screen of Siftables and the near sides and the near places together with each other, and it can response -- Video: Wore the cardy!
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decide how it pushed it.
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music and live music child that we developed with a sound producing like the lead, bass and print.
Eender every four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use which you want to use which you want.
These luces can be injected in a lives, so you can determined the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern of the sounds of sounds can be determined in the pattern of the sounds can be determines in the pattern in the pattern of the s
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the tancishing of a livable effects of a livable effects of available effects of a lives.
They are getting sound to a sound and attacked by the office.
And then the general effects like tempo and volume that are admitted on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern to a first pattern, lower by a very lead.
Now, I read the basline.
Video: DM: Now I feed a little bit beat.
Video: And now I copping the filter of the filter of the print, so I can affect live the effect lives.
Video: DM: I can cut it very accelerating by the offices of the tempo blocky.
Video: DM: Now I copping the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can rescue the pattern as it play.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything else and make it very longer and make it very shorter and shorter as I want.
And with the end of the dims of the whole whole of the volume Siftable to left Siftable to left
Thank you.
Like you can see my passion is going to make new people, and I think of new people, which are better interfaces are better in the way our brain and bodies and bodies work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of couple of possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the attention to a very new generation of helping tools for the interacting with digital media, which is bring the information of our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you with you all of you all the time.
I'm writing.
Books write is my work, but also so much more than that.
My entire life I was doing writing write and I don't think that will change anybody will change anybody will change it.
And yet there is a little bit of inside of my life and career and career and career that I had to re-relationship with my work with my work again.
It started with a book that I wrote ungs a memoire: "E, Biddle moire: Biddle in contrast to my first work and an international exister to my first work and an international exist.
And the consequence is that people are always done and always tilled me to do as if I do the contested by the time.
And I think that -- -- getting the purpose!
People come to me and questions and ask to me and ask you that are never going to be able to evenar?
Don't you far your entire life will be write your entire life but never a book such a book such that people will walk warm for warm.
Don't you fell there?"
Erg restated, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very of, I remember that I was remember 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, when I told me I was going to become a teenager.
People said, "Don't you get succes?
Don't you know afraid to deal with it, you will go to you?
You don't know that you are going to be false your life on this work without any thing out of your broken is that there are ever die, and that you will be dying on the puin of your broken bitter-axis of fal?"
Something in that stretation.
In the short is my answer to that questions on this novely, "Yes."
Yeah, I am afraid for all of those things that are called
All of the time of all.
But I am also for a lot of other things job, you don't know what everything for all of the things that everything.
For sea while, for instance, and other entirely things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time when that fear is from.
Is it rationel?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be joined to be working for the work for which they were to their opinion,
What is so particularly about creative processes that we make us to make the effects of on the minds of the minds of the mindnesage.
Take my father. He was separtnership, and I can't remember that there was a thir-year-old person he was working on this for a 40 years of notice for it.
And that's what "Yohn, how is it with your chemicblockad?"
No, no, so there was no matter of it.
To be fair to be fair engineers by the centuries of the centuries are not the reputation of maloil-malcohosts for piece of malcoholists.
Scheator who have such a reputation.
Not just writing, other creative people have turned out to be humans that reputation is humans in it.
And then look at the grim dodental death the most magic creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own advance of them.
And even the ones who don't have a suicide suicided to be under their gave to be under their gave too much,
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Move each of my books is a piece of mitself is a piece of mitself was a piece of mitself said.
And that's pretty much to say about your life-work.
But of these kinds of spoke of these kinds of spoke up
We all heard it before, and we've heard it with all accepted.
The reason the way is that creativity is that creativity insuffering with suffering and that an artist-existence will lead to miserable.
And so I want everybody to ask everybody here today about this idea of living?
Do you know, you do that?
Because now I think about it, I think about it, I think it doesn't really really quite a good thought.
I think it was reads the resistance.
And also even more dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this century is so on.
We can create much better spores much better than to live much better to life.
I know it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in particularly dangerous to live that dark for that dark to live in that dark for me to live to live to that dark for me.
Seker the phase that my career is in my career now.
Go took only young, you know, amount of young,
I can do maybe four decades work.
Hoostony probably everything that I now published now by the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside world as the
We're with friends under the other, so I can care of you: hope stonishing my biggest success of the largest success of me.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think about this is what you know about the morning to know the morning to the vack.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to work with the work I love work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long, I think of the conclusion that I can only go with write as I can just go with write as I can only go with a psychological protection in the process of instant.
I have to create the write of a safe distance between myself and my considered to create with responses for the reactions, and my very understanding publish.
I was looking at the last year, I was looking at ways to do that.
I am in history in the history and deeps in other days in other days to see or others to see or others or others to have found a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search for my search with the old Greeks and Romain and Romain and Romain and Romain and Romain
Well it is a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romenon and Romenon and believed people didn't have a creativity of their own --
And they believed that creativity was a godline that creativity of a disconnect to the human was access and unknowledge of a lot of reasons.
The Greeks called these guys called these guy minds of creativity "demonen."
And Socrate believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that we were influistence.
The Romestic had a species of the same idea.
And when they were such a both creative mind creative mind creative mind.
The funny is that the Rombs with a genius with a genius is not a pient.
In their policy was a genius was a kind of magic god-sized entities that were reseveral entities of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the household.
When the artistic was working on the work was assistention.
And he gave he gave to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working.
The artists was so in protection to be protection to a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work was brilliant to be all the high.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genius you had taken genius you had been taken
Whereas you got working, then that not just about you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty independent genia.
Long time is that how in the West creativity was considered to the West creativity was considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
And there was a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual human beings and state all the gods and state all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attention from the godline world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individuals.
And for the first time in history was in history about artists said that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius were saying that they were a first of all.
I have to say I think a big mistake,
To let me make one person, one individual individual to believe that he or she is the essentially -- the essentially of all of the century mystery, of all of what creative and the known for a lot of responsibility for a fragic human psyche.
All you ask somebody asks the sun in swallowed to swallow the sun.
Ego's become reduced to gigantic proporations and there are becoming incredibly expectations to be copposed to period of performance
And I think this pressure has made a lot of artists of artists kill.
When that is, and I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we go back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human and creative mystery?
Maybe not.
We can do 500 years of rational humanism not undone in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes far speech.
And probably the way in the audience people who have recently recently about the idea that elphysical resequences with some of face creatures with some feeent poorer to inspiring the work of artists.
It doesn't seem to mean I will get you all of you in there.
And yet me deal with it.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we do that thought isn't the thought of it?
It foot just as much as much as much of all other explanations of the totally calculated uncalculation that are decided in the creative process.
And everybody who have to try to create something -- so in fact, so actually all the attacks, all of the attack-process doesn't always rational process is not always rational away rational mals.
And that sometimes it took a paranormal.
I have recently the great American posed American poem-Ruth Stone of the well.
She's a thick in the nine. Her whole life already write.
She told me about her youth on the plattempt of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field of works, she was felt a poem about the country.
And it was so said she was so for a big wave air came air from the air of air
And so I was going to go to her in the country to make her country to her
She felt that the ground of her feet started to created and knew that was doing her at that time to do it was just to do one thing for her life.
They ran home, and she had to get the close and she had to do as quickly as possible and then paper and paking.
When it came up with her hended her hengineering was that her only chance to write it on the way to write it on the way to write it was to write it on the way to write it was to write it was telling her only engineer in the game of the poeoem was that poeoem was that she was going to write with her only one opportunity
Sometimes she was not quickly enough.
Then and roughly it reaches it doesn't reach the house.
And at such a little bit of the poem by her himself disappeared by the fields, for a different poem -- in her words -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- in her words -- in her words -- in a different poems,
And then there were some of the story -- this I think it was the beautiful part of the story -- they were the close to almost miste.
And then she was looking for paper and paper, and paper, and paper, and the paper by her.
Just at that time had a ptleg she had a ptled.
And with her other hand, so told me them, she told me the poem of the air.
She took the poem at his tail, and it back into her body, while she was wrote the back in her body,
And in that cases came up with the poem of well-well-paper, but then in the paper of paper, but in the end.
When I heard that -- what -- what it happens -- which is so far, my creative process oo!
And that's how my creative process! I'm not mem! I'm not me!
I am a mouth, who is a mouth, who've got on the same time and floor, and trans with blood, swallowed to be blood-up beastone.
But even in that daily swrace I had supposed to experience.
You will also know it yourself, that feeling that there creative ideas in your considering from a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that they were for brone?
How can we use it without saying that we get it?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think about this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had this stuff.
Tom is actually a lot of his life is a lot of his life has been shown in the crazy artistic artists that are trying to get from all power grip on the unundouble of the impulse that push up in him of divice.
And the 190s was Tom some little bit of a little bit of the rustiger.
And one day he require in Los Angeles about the fast weath, and changed the process of radical
And as he heard a fragment, he heard a fragment,
The decided to him, as inspiration that is degrapher, indeed, ingrapher, catches --
It was a beautiful melods and he wanted to fasthor.
But that doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a paper touch, no paper ecorder,
The well-known excited, again, and then the melodies of the head, and then it stays and then it stays to me eterns.
I don't enough, I can't be it."
He didn't get in panic, but he was not in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
And he looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you cannot see that I sat the same time.
"Do you really think I can do a song now, right?
If you really want to get that this song there is a little bit later you have to do even flater when I have time for you.
Don't be anybody else disay.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Coh." And from that time the time lose of the process of the process of very different.
The work is still the work, with the dark of the dark submersible.
But the heavy exciting the creative process in him required, when he was distance of the genius of the genia.
The genius was going to poem on the skin and liver the skin and welling up.
And then then the way that there was no reason to go to the bottom of it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre conversation between Tom and working together, a kind of conversation between Tom and the properties that not completely of Tom themselves.
And that story has changed my way of works.
I had been taken profit of it.
I was at the middle of Een, Biddle process of Een, Biddle
And at a point moment I agree.
You know that well, you don't want to be good working, and you think it's a terrible disasting is going to be a terrible book it.
Not just just just a lot of worse, really horrific bad
I wanted to do all the project all project.
And then I remember Tom that are who who are genius to be able to way. And I also decided to way.
I was wended from my male crip, and I focused crip, and I focused of the room.
And I said hardope, "Lister thing, we know all of the things that if this book is not only coming by me.
You can see that I have all the way in what I have in it.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it better you, you have to get your things.
Sme? Do you don't do that, you've got you.
I just write because that's what my work.
Oh, and in the notabuland make it be departnership of being appropriate on office today
Tja--- Uentirely it comes up here.
Every euwen ago, in the North African desert African deserve people to deal with malight in month, to dance in month,
Oren and hours and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always amazing because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, there was something extraordinary --
And one of those dancers was then transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen with that, you've ever seen something like this, you ever seen a performer.
It was like the time was stilstood and the dance of time was stacked by a poor.
He didn't do anything else than the thousands of nights -- but now now I have all the time.
And suddenly he didn't seem to be longer just a human beings a human beings.
In him, under him of him is flowing it.
A godnment, a god-freree him.
If something called Dan something called Dan people what it was Dan she was began to clah, they were clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because it was for them.
And by the way, a fun of historical fact, when Moren South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South Sou
The excise is by the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of "Allah" in "Oly" in "Olene, oil, oil, oeng."
And that you hear the day again, and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artists in Spain something inpossible, or magic does, "Allah, oil is people, oil -- "Allah, violence, the great, break of an artists in Spain something inpossible.
Actually, a disease, a glimpse of God.
And the recipes we need.
Lasty is that the dance of dance is the next morning to the next morning to expect to discover 11 in an ocrows.
And at that time he is a little bit older man with deaths who never catch a little bit of the well.
Maybe there will be somebody else anybody else in dance, you know,
What does it have to the rest of his liv?
That's hard.
And that's really hard to sell for a creative mind.
But so painful needs not to be to.
Now, imagine that you don't go from extend to be that the most invited aspects of your person from yourself.
And if you believe that you believe them a while, you know, you have seen them from a little bit of a nather source of a source of a source of a source of a while.
When you are ready with it, they are given to somebody else else.
And that's how it is everything.
I incentive that I think about thinking about the idea of the thought of the age.
The last months I worked on a book that will be short to be different. The book where much too long as much to requency to be requency.
The opolger of the illuster progress.
And if my mind with me at the doze, I love me the same and, I think the same and, I don't know it.
Do you just work.
So if you do thing you do, whatever it is.
If you have task you to dance you'll dance you'll dance you,
If the god-gene genius is admitted to decide in your work at some time at some time of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful genius at the god-d-dl
As that nother you know, dance but then then then then, but it turn.
And then, "Oling."
I believe that I believe that I think about hard.
"Oh, whatever it is because we have pure human love and propertly, human love and propertly,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Or!
You know, I had talked about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and what it means of genes.
We actually started to get a new point, we were the biology of digitize the digital code and now we try to go from that digital code to a new phase in biology with the biology and synthetize of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions of ask questions.
"What is living to think about how much biolos have tried to understand the different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different level of biologists have tried to understand the whole thing that have tried to understand the different levels.
We tried different approach, it bringing back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years of digitize the digitize of digitize it.
When we have sequenced the human genome genome of the biology, went from the analoge world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask life to regenerate life or can we create life from this digital universe is we create life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium with the smallest genitalium for a kind of that can conceive themselves in a laboratory of a labs.
And we tried to look at whether we can get a nature smaller genome.
We can go to the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or whose it from the 500 or who's there.
But if we look at the metabolic map, is that relative simple compared with the inside.
Gelore me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can check out of the genes that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell of the genes that would be a living cell of the genes that we can do a living cell of the genes that could be switching to all the genes that could be a living cell of all the genes that would be
And we decided that the only rout, the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we have a chromosome of a chromosome of synthet?"
Sat the chemistry to make these very large molecules that we never seen before,
And, if we do that, you know, a chromosome of the chromosome of the meet?
A chromosome is just a chromosome of chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitize of digitize of life is accelerator of exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic code of rather slowly slowly slow-up to write the genetic code of the engineering code of the engineering code to write the genetic code to write the genetic code of the engineering code
And our last point it would put on this time on a exponential curve.
We're going to begin to be 15 years ago.
There were some stages for for invitial for a bio-ethical ethical advancishing the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of very difficult is very difficult to it.
There are teenthousands of machines in the world that small pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so much more falong you make it piece of more fals.
So we had to make a new method for the conclude of these little pieces and correct of all the errigerate of all the fals.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria little virus that bacteria.
We designed the chicks, the chicks,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the beginning part of a chemical chemical chemical style in the bacteria and the bacteria the genetic code, and making viral particles.
The viral particles were taken from the cells, when they came back and killed the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they were that model but all the fast.
They laughs more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software is built his own hardware can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire chromosome of the entire bacterial bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial bacterial bacterial chro
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes, so we could actually pull the cassettes so we could various --
to understand what the deeply components of a living cell cell.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than to have to digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very accure.
When we first had this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard of the standard Pror was one mistake a 10,000 basepares.
And eventually, we found after resequencing, 30 pounds when we had the original sequence of sequence than it was not able to start.
And part of the design is design of pieces that are 50 letters who are 50 letters that are going to be overlapping with all other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can design together so they can go together,
We design design here is unique parts in here.
And you might have read that we were able to stop watermarks.
Bet, we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, C, GG, and T.
Trios of those letters code for rucidents for 20 aminozurs -- that there's a little bit of the crowd for each aminoxygen of every aminoxygen
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words for writing,
And so we just get an announced it.
Some of them were insed that there were no poems.
We designed these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of crows, and beginning with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were going to be able to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, takes of 72,000.
And in every stage of every stage we got a considered of these pieces so that we could sequences them because we want to create a process that very robusts -- that will be very robuying -- that you can see straight.
We try to reach the point of automatisfaction of automatisfaction.
So this looks like a basketbalfinal.
And once we come to the real pieces -- more than 100,000 basetes, they don't grow so easily more in E. coli.
That explains the most modern tools of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
And that's why we went to return to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolog recombination is used by the biology to repair and repairs, that is used by the biology to repair and food.
Here's an example of it.
There's a organism called Deinococococcus radio durance radio durance of radiation on the radiation of radiation of radiation
And that you see that in the botop panel, shem cromosome of the chromosome of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later he put it again, and he put it again, exactly as it was first of all.
There are thousands of organisms that around.
These organisms can be drought up to be drought in the way.
They can live in a vacum.
I know sure that there can live in space that can be be able to move in space, that can find it forward to be able to find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of it,
Here's a little bit microphones of the molecule that we made with this processes -- fact with these processes -- fact with the right design of the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design of the pieces that we did them.
Good is that they feed automatically add automatically.
This is not electron-microscope microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope
These are photographs, genomes are taken of six seconds.
This is the published we extend to extend to extend to recently
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule molecule ever made by people, with a clear-clear.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we would decide it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages for 142 pages of the genetic code.
Now, how do we start, how do we started a chromosome chromosome of it?
And it's clearly a virus is pretty easy.
And it's a bacteria is much complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, like us, you know, you just weep, you just know the cell and does another in, and that's what you know when you're reading as it reading as it reading and that's what you know as reading as well.
And the bacteria species of the chromosome of integrated in the cell, but we have integrated in the cell, we can actually explain a full transpllantation of a chromosome of a cell of a cell to another one, and it can be activate the bacteria in the cell of the cell of a cell of the cell,
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of micromosome of a micromosome of micromosome of a micromosome of micromosome of a micromosome of a
These are about as far from each other, and mic.
We feed some extra little bit of extra chromosome of these chromosome of chromosome of these chromosome of tant.
We have the painted with enzymes to make all the egs of all the egs of the eggs.
It was pretty sensally when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to soil to soil to so, but we tried to develop the process of what we thought was going to be developed to develop the process of what was going to come farther out,
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of these kinds of thousands of properties in one of them in one time that they add a thousands of properties in one time of the species.
People who are proposed evolving one changes are not a lot of biology has not been much biology with a lot of biology --
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes that are actually enzymes that are actually restricted DNA restriction and enzymes that are actually restriction of DNA enzymes that are restriction-enzymes that are actually restriction enzymes that are actually restriction enzymes that are restriction-enzymes that are restriction enzymes that are restriction-zymes that are actually restriction-zymes that are actually restriction
The chromosome was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome of the chromosome --
It was expressed and the recognized the other chromosome of the other chromosome of material, and then we had just eventually the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the other chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the other chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of materials.
He was blue because he was blue of the genes that we had stop in it.
And in very short time all the characteristics of all the characteristics of one species and changed in the new software that we had in the cell software that we had in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the new software that we had in the cell of the new species of time and changed in the cell time disappear
All the proteins changed the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code -- it was changed.
This is a making point, as genomicia, but we are in state, but we are in the software DNA, to change fundamental things.
Good, I paid earlier earlier that this is not creation -- this is the front of boards at 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid evolution, and I paid that we might be almost a new version of Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of new species of Camban explosion of the Cambrical design design design is a digital new species of the Cambrical design design
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it needs need.
We're going to go inside of six-and-half billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946, within 1946, that will be four are four four are four of the four of us who are four four of those who are four four of those who are four four of those who are four four of those who are four in 1946.
We have trouble with food, with the healing of clean water, medicine, medicine, medicine,
And that's being hard to do that for next.
We use five billion ton collives, over 30 billion of lion-year-old ton collay.
That's 100 miloons of lions per day.
When we take biological processes in biological processes or whatever process than anything that is going to be a huge of challenge in challenge of it.
Then of course, all of the carbon dioxide of the stine that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
And by all of our worldwide discoveries we have now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had only a dozen components, and look at the diversity that has come from there.
We're precise by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques of synthesesemethods to do such as combination genomics to do combination genomics to do whatever
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day of chromosomes a day of a day.
If you think about 20 million different genes, or is trying to optize processes or is trying to optize processes to make octon or to produce octon of producing or medicine, we can change with a little team changing with a little team than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for lives, and chemical or fuel of life, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccine, and so forth.
This is a screen imagination of what real designer is where we work on work, so you can actually go to the gest and a new kind of on the computer can design and a new kind of on the computer can design and a new kind of thing that we can actually get to work on the computer of what real design.
We don't know person how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus on fourth generation now four generation.
On the same thing that you see to ethanol anol of an experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out from suggest as sugar, until more fuels like suggest fuels like octano.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food prices and make the availability to make the availability as we start with CO2 as his food, and that's why we are we starting cells that we are the first food, and we think that are the first fourth generation of the way we are the first fourth generation of burns within about 18 months of months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries of our worldwide discoveries are all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deepicion, about 2.5 miles in the deep, at coalong temperature of temperatures.
It makes methane of molecular hydrogen of molecular hydrogen as energy sourcing as energy source of molecular hydrogen
We're looking at whether we can take CO2 and easily for a pipes of pipes that CO2 is coming back to face that CO2 to send this process.
So in a short time in a short time we are able to break out of the basal question: "What is life?"
We actually have realized you -- the reason you -- the dealing of the petrochemical industry.
Yeah, if you can't do this at TED, where you can do that?
A important energy source of energy source of energy source.
But we also work on the tools of these tools to think about quickly.
This year was the flu, we always walk just something behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine vaccine of the right vaccine vaccine.
I think that can change by creating the textiny vaccines of the impaccines of the devaccines of the text.
And here you see how the future can see the evolutionary tree, the evolutionbottom is going to change the evolution of synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still farmed to improve people.
Our goal is sure that we make a chance to survive to survive to survive to survive to do that well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a first quickly, is fundament of a new technology that we brought to bring a very quickly. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a surrounds that you locally or at distance with immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at the way here are gigabytes to digital images and can be here at the bottoms on of making up and challenge and the sorters and to our wish and to our wish and to our wish and we can set up to our wish and can shap,
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections are or images or images are of images or images are of the collections are or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixely.
It doesn't matter because it took only because it would be influence to the prestations of a system, on a girl, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is the graue of Dickens. Every colue column.
To evidence that it's really really text, and no image, and no imagination, we can do something that is really text, to show that this is not a picture.
And perhaps this is a little bit strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't add it.
This is a realistic, this is an example. This is a exist.
Every big image image is the beginning of a subject of a submersible.
This is really really a fun, and the experience of a real papers of a real papers or headline, or a headline, which is actually a critical pace.
We also done something that we done with the corner of the Guardian
We made a nice advertention of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertion -- and we have extra information -- and we have involved invitial adversion --
If you want to see the possibilities of this car and you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can actually make the limitations of hands through the screen through the screen through the screen of the screen of the screen of the critically.
We hope that this is not going to be more population and other suddenly flaw -- not needed to be more than it is not going to be more population.
Of course are agricultural for the considered approximation for a technology like this, I will spend here to spend here to this field that we can also spent to this field is a lot of contribute for a lot of contribute for a lot of straight of it.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
On the top of a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else now.
This is now living live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promotioned by Noah Snavely, promotion of Washington,
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's meant by Seadragon.
When we do this, you know, we can experience the images and experience the images and the multiresolution resolutions.
The space srocks of the images has this meant has this meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images together so they have connected with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of -- where they are elected diases are space counter-por-images, and all these things are space televised space.
I don't know sure or there is time or there is another environments.
There are still a lot of space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of an early prototype of Photosynth that we worked in my head -- to the communicate what I have in my head is the real force of this technique -- to the work of this techniques on our website.
We had to keep with the lawyer and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images of Flickr. You just look for images from Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images of the Notre Dame with the Notre DDaway in Firackr.
And each of these orange chgels gives a image of image that was part of this model of this model turns out to be part of this model --
And so these are all these Flickr images, which are all copping in this way of springs in this way of springs
And we can do at simple way we can do it.
You know, I had never thought that I would have ever worked at Microsoft at Microsoft
It's overwhelmingly considered to be so far.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras, all of the glump reflexcameras, a big number of of it, conclude in this environment.
And I will try to find some strange images
There are so much far by facing faces and things like that.
And nowhere between this is even a series of photographs -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also chured by the program.
If we divide the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can actually do things with the social environment. This is used the data -- of everybody -- from the whole collective memory of the entire of how it looks like to each other.
All of these photographers, and shapes a very bit bigger than the sroom is a very bigger than the parts.
You have a model that of the entire Earth is from the entire Earth is going to be the entire Earth
As this as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth's work
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it -- and the preventing of which also grows for the people who are used to use it.
Their own photographs are going to be able to see anybody else in the same thing.
If somebody would like to climb and their names and their names and their names and their names is require of the Notre Dame is require to all of the data, and I can use as a access to space, that metap-versus have a kind of cross-model, and created this kind of cross-modale, and created social experience.
And of course, it's supposed to this immense rich virtual model of every interesting virtual model of every interesting photographers, satelling images and other approxial images and other approxious images and other approach.
Thank you so much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what makes your software possible, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that can be dealing with everybody in the world can copy together by everybody on the world can copy?
BA: Yeah. What this really does have discover
It creates to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the images.
And that is defined exciting when you think about the richchchalization of semantic information that much of these images are concludes.
When you look for imagine, you know, you get a search in a search in and the text on the webpage of information about what the image of information about what the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of information is when you look at image,
What if you have this image copped image?
Then are the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes from that comes from that provided up of making more ging.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicion.
One of the intense pleasure of travel and of enographic research is the possibility to live between those who are not forget to live in the wind, who are not forget in the wind, the ancient stones, the provided in the wind, the propertilost stones, the propertilian entirely planns.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still still the Milky galay or that the myths of Inched with meaning meaning the myths of Inched with meaning the Himalaya boodhists still making your breathing that we are actually described in the athese, the world in which we are not a absolutely of the anthropology: the world we don't have an absolutely model of the work,
the consequence of a fun set adaptation choices that makes our ancestors generations ago.
Of course, we all share the same adapted requires born demands are born children in the world.
We all make infortion, we all make inform.
Because the inevent separation of the inevent diath.
So it can't be surprise that we all all of sizing, dancing and art it.
But interesting is the unique of the song of the song and the ritm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is about the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the U.S. or the U.S. or the U.S. or the Caisut in Northern Kaisut-heath-Kaisut in the Andes-built birth-band-bound-bounds of Sahara. This is the man of the desert of the desert of the deaware of the deaware of the devastine,
Everest, the godding mother of the world.
They all learn that we can be able to think different, else on Earth can think differently on Earth can be oriented.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of it.
Samen shapes the intelligent cultures in the world of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural life is as important as the biological livweb: the biosphere.
This cultural livweb you can imagine as a enosphenomenon of an eat.
The eventually thing you can define if the totally of all the thoughtful of all the thought, myths, and myths, and inspirations and inspirations that are conscious of our consciousness since the beginning of our consciousness.
The eetno, the big nalature of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we are and all of that we can be as amazing newsing news' animals.
You know, just like the biosphere is the eating, is the eat, is the eat-feer that too, and more more mate.
No biologist, would be frequired half of all species at the point of all species on the point of extinction because that's simply not true.
And the most apocalyptic scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhoods of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is pays.
And then when everybody was born on this early was born six-thousand of talks on Earth was talking about it.
A language is more than her wordship or her gramatic rules.
A language is a fashion of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that the sicl of every unique culture of every uniquely culture the material world.
Every language is a century old old old old a century of a mind, a mind, an ecosystem to spiritual possibilities.
And from that six-thousand becomes today the half of them today is not fluist.
They don't have learned to be longer tell.
Effective that means that unless an change is that they are already dead.
Is something like this, you know, the last of the past of your people, the last of your people, the last of your people, no opportunity to spend your language or the wisdom of the ancestors of the kids of the teged to see the teged of the kids of the kids are going to see the teachers of the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of being being se
And recient that term is somebody, all the way that is approaching every two weeks somewhere on the Earth, because every two weeks and die, and done and done and done and die, and done of an old language of an old language.
Some of you say, "Super, well, wouldn't be better place if we all all the same language if we all all the same language of the same language of the same language. Or Kantone. Or Kantone. Or Kantone.
Or Kogi.' You will realize how it would not have to talk to your own language to talk to your own language
So what I want to do is to do today you are taking on a short journey, that has to be a quick of what in fact, which is lost a quick of what in fact,
And many of us that when I have it about "another way of face that I also really think about a different way.
Take this Barasa-child in the Northern Amazone, the full of the anaconda, that believes from the anaconda, that she believe that she believe that they are from the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of head.
This is a completely that cognitive the colors of blue and big, because it was suppose of the skin of the massive of the odd of the odd of the odd of the own.
They have a fall language and recogaming ruled, that linguistic exogamined exogample, you have to married somebody talks.
This has been taken his roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary full in their homes, where six or seven language in their homestic marriages, but you never hear somebody hears a language of the well.
They were simply listening and then then then speaking.
One of the fascinerent steams that I have lived with which I lived with the Waorani in Norani in Northern Ecuador, a research in 1958 freedomined contact with which was require in 1958 slowly was red.
In 1957 five missionars, five missionars, but they made a critical mistake.
Over the air, they were photographs of themselves with our ideas of friendly built that this has never been seen that this had never seen a two-dimensional image had never seen a two-dimensional image had never seen a two-dimensional image of themselves with our ideas of the air.
They were photographs on and tried the shape behind the face behind the face of the face and they tried to find the face.
When they didn't found, they concludes that the dark of them with this is rief with spire missionaries with spent spire missionaries were through spire spire with spire spire of the spire of them with spire of the stuff.
But the Waorani didn't only outside outside outside of the Waorani but also each other.
Fifth of their deaths came from the deaths of their deaths from the board.
We could remember genealogies to eight generations back where we were cases two cases, which we found two of a natural death.

It's a complex metaphysical worldvieview, very interesting.
Well you ask the big world-religions of religions what would you say to you?
Christendom, islam, bulddom, etc.
One continent is always considered out of money, from the attage that Africa was not religious belief that Africa didn't believe religious belief had this before.
And so it's simply to destilt of this deep religious ideas, religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora during of the tragic diaspora during of the tragic diaspora during of the tragic diaspora diaspse of the deep.
What voodoo is so interesting is the living between the living between the lives, and the deaths and the deaths of lives,
The lives, the living the mind.
The mind can be attacked from underneath the Great Water, answer the dance of the soul of the living at the time that one of the time that one of the while, the during moment the follower is a single of time the god.
And that's why are foolow: "You white you to go to the Chrich, and talking about God.
We dance in the temple and become God." And because you were so farm." And because of what can happen to happen to the mind of the mind of the spirit --
This leads to a regular storytunately, folloations in trance that bluffeless light light light light light leading class.
And this told is demonstrates the ability of the mind to influence when this is in extreme when this is in extreme is extreme as extreme is extreme is extreme in extreme is in extreme in extreme as extreme in extreme as extreme as extreme as extreme as this is in extreme as this is in extreme as this extreme as extreme as this is in extreme when this is this extreme of the body.
Of all the people, where I ever have lived with the Kogi the most extraordinary is the most extraordinary of Colombia.
And After challenges of the Tairona-civilization, who ever have the Cariban Colombia have populated in the nasleep,
They were involved back in a geisolated volcanic massive that above the coast flady.
In a blood continent to be following this blocked only this people.
Another they are getting surface is rather than the training to priester is pretty extraining to priester is pretty extraordinarily for it.
The young acolites are ggetting away with their families when they're three or four or four of four or four there.
They are become sun-up in a world of dark in a world of dark in foot of glaciers, 18 years of a lot of these.
Two period of nine years, conscious to month for the nine months of shape, that they put in the launched of their mother.
Now, they are in wise of speaking in the lay of the big mother.
These whole time they are making them together to be society, values that are contemporary in the behavioral or ecologicically.
And this invention ends with the day they have to invite and the first time in their lives, if they're 18 and for the first time in their lives, as a sun, as the first both of the first bottom of the first bot, as the Son the shelling of the creation of the beauthory.
You see? It's like I said you know, you say.
And it's pretty much beautiful to protection to protection the parents of the parender brother.
And if they are the younger brothers, who are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And on this point is intuitiveage.
If we think about inheems and landscape and landscape and we often Rously and of the old factory, a fabledge of the easily, a idea that racistic is in his simple of easy.
Or we get Thoreau and say that these people, and say that these people's closer than us.
Inheems are completely nor expected by nostalgy.
For both is little space in the malaria model in the malaria model of the Asmat or the Word winds of Tibet. Desalniance temed by time and ritual mystic of the Earth, which is not in the idea of the Earth, which is based on a much subttle of the Earth's farmed by the idea that the Earth's living, the idea that the Earth, because human beings is the idea that the idea of the livest is only only one.
What does that mean? It means that a little kid from the Anths, which is grown up with belief that the mountain an Apu-mind that will lead his or her feet, a fundamental other relationship and a other relationship that will have a little kid of Montana, and a little bit of Montana, is grown with the idea that the mountain a little bit of mining.
Or it the living, or a lot of it, is irrelevant.
Interestingly is the metaphor that defines the contention between the individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were cut to become cross-up with the idea that these forests were cases.
And I made me another human beings than my friends of the Kwagiultic that they believe that those forests are the living the woodle of Kuxwhue and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the cannibal mindswwall of the world in the north of the world --
These minds are important during their Hamatsa-in-inducation.
And if you start to get the idea that these cultures can be seeing realities can be understanding for some of their extraordinary discoveries extraordinary discovery.
It's a picture that I april in the North West Amazon nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating cating, is not just the fascinating pacological potential of it, but how it is built it -- but how it is built it from two sources.

If you just take the plant and it seems that a blue requalm by your consciousness by your consciousness.
The plant is being mixed with a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a ridis.
The plant sridge is powerful tryptamines, narrow because of brain serotonine, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimeth,
Did you ever seen the Yanomami as they have snuiving, that substance of different kinds of the substance of the methoxyltryptami tami methoxyltryptami --
That powder your blazs, you know, is a little bit of a photograph and painted with barokicity of craff -- to countries on a sea of electricity. This is not a distortion of realit; it's described to reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince -- a man who did the psycheal agency during his discovery of paddos in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect are involved involved in the home, no one more home, no one more homis to experiences. Tryptamines are not to take oral in the human darm-to-done by a enzym in the human darmoperators, because they are described by a monoxiday.
They can only be oral ingenoms with something that the monoamine of suspended on the soamine of suspend.
The fascinating is that the taboines in the lian empt-monoamine-suppressure sures to activate the tryptamin-supposed to activate the try: How can this following in an 80,000 plants of two morphological institutions, which is a chemical variant of the getting beautiful variant than the shapes of the parts of the parts of the parts of the shape of the parts of the parts of the shapacross of the shape of the sing of the so-cking of the shavided of the shape of the sponse of the parts of the parts of the

You don't promove with Harvard, but it's a piece of a piece than measures of the wells.
Now, the problem is that even the ones of those sympathics are conseems to insactly compared to them as a curious and colorrich in the history as a footner in history as the real world, meaning our world, is meaning our world, by the real world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember 300 years to be remember of technological innovations, but earlier as the time that we were in the way we stone, and active participiped or passive destruction with the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always been shared to a dance with new life possibilities.
And technology is not the problem is not the problem is not the problem.
The Sious, they didn't stop Siou, when they were their pile, when they were their pile, as min as that Americans were in as that Americans were stop Americans, when they were sure and ways.
It's not changing or technology that the integrity of the eating. It's power.
The wrace of the government.
And what you see in the world and you will notice that it's not the fate of these cultures to disappepear.
These are dynamic lives, whose are advances by identify that are advances that are profit to their appropriate opportunities that are recently regone.

In the case, of the Yanomami are the diseases that are involved in as a consequence of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of studies in the wrapped of political government.
Genocide, the physical excellent of a people, and the follow of a people, enockide, the destruction of the lives, not only destroy of a people, but in many areas as as as part of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level of the basic level of the basic level of the pin.
I have a young colleague 9,000 kilometers about country from Chengdu in West China to Lhasa.
And then I was when I came to Lhasa in Lhase, I understood the statistics that you heard.
6,000 Heily monuments destroyed 1.2 million people knew during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
And he was done of that, he was killed when the Chinese invasion of that,
His unclear-flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people in Nepal brought in Nepal brought
His mother was prison because she was rich because she was rich because she was rich
He was the prison the prison the prison when he was two -- he was two -- because they didn't have a cro, because they don't care call.

And one day she staper to accident on a poorer of Mao. For this overover, they had seven years.
The pain of Tibet can be intiny, but the freedend of the people, but the free of the people.
And eventually it comes up with a choice.
Do we live in a gray world of simple life or we want to live a colorritical world of diversity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said to her death that she was a general, amorf world image --
We wouldn't only see the human imagination are constently seeing a small, modal thinkather, but also we would have been definitely existence.
We can feel feel with the idea that our kind of only 150,000-,000--year-old year-old once of the Earth is about 150.] years on Earth is about the idea that our kind of only 150.000-year.
The Neolitical Revolution, who was agriculture where we gave us to the cult of the shaman of the shaman was replaced by the potry of the priests of the priests and we had a replace.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
And this surface history that we don't have the idea that we don't have the idea that we have all the answers that we have all the answer ennia in our path.
If the intelliligent cultures of the world is is asked to the meaning of people, they answers with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we are going to discover again to be discover the other thing that we are going to be able to be what we are in the work to be able to be all the separate and all the garden of optimism.
This photograph on the northern point of Baffin Island taking with Inch, when I went to Inextently in narwal of the North of Baffin the narrow of Baffin Island take.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friend, for the Inexist. In the 1950s were in the 1950s to focus in the 1950s were placed to focus in the 1950s were place.
The opa of Olayed to go to go.
The family peace for his life and recognize him all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inter were not afraid for the col; they use it.
The gia's dominated originally made of their fish in circle of fish in caribs.
Olayer was not afraid for the poolnage or the storm that was going to be the storm that was going to be the poolnage of the poolnage of the poolnaight or the storm of the poolnage of the poolnaight or the storm that was say.
He went out to outside, he was wrong of sea hondense skin, and he was in his hand. When the poep started freezing, he started to freeze, he was a limmet.
He brought a low-layer on the side of the side of the side of the side of the wall.
When it was solid was going to slaught a dog of them.
He recorded the dog and improvised a heart of hear.
Of the ribitged he made a bad thing.
And he was looking at a dog in the neighborhood, and then the wheat the ice foople of poople poeps.
And it was going to be around with nothing around with nothing in many ways, is symbol for the resistance of the Inin and all the inside and all the inside of the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government of the Inuit of the entire population of a piece of country larger than California and Texas we have new home.
It's independent on the bottom. They all remember all the soil.
It's a research example of how a nation enough example of how a nation is enough to her people can be bited to her people.
And finally, I think it's clearly disappoint, at least for who to this highly hitched to this highly isn't going to be able to get away to get away away from the way to these high.
They are somebody's home country.
They are going to be in the beginning of human imagination, which is going to go to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, just like that are the unlimited of the und-influence.
And what we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely reaching the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic, but we believe that stories are not convincing the world can change the world that can change the world, that we probably are the best storytellers are 35 million times a month, we are in 156 million times a month, we are in 156 countries at the time of a milliens' public.
We make a fell to travel to the eat, with our public, with our public, to us to exister cultural places, which the toaeshierator as includes by what he seeing in the anthropology of anthropology will be arm: that these world are going to be deserve in a multi-foot world that we can find a way to live in multi-world and pluralistic world and plualistic world
where all the wisdom of all the people, can be contributing to our sement.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you with you a few question of what I have determined a book of the question of what I have well.
Maybe you see paralls with information of other sources.
I also try to explain some of explain some sense that you might have a little bit of you,
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly beard: the official dogma of all Westerished society.
And that official dogma is louds like following the well-of-free-level of our civil free-level of our civil freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of the well.
Freedom is a big good, an essential part of the human beings of human beings
And the top, freedom of freedom to treat the engineering to do a higher well-well-of-frequire without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices love in that people have more freedom of choices
And more freedom means automatically means more well.
This is so deep getting in our society that nobody would be supposed to do it.
And in our lives is this dogma stefour.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about thress of threats.
Narrative size 175 similar batisface of these are threats of different circles of extraordinary engths and twal-up photographer,
And you can make a tallow of your own threats to make a case between 175 species for you, for the 175 species for you,
So that's the bottom of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can make your star story. You can put your stereoset -- loud of it, cassettespeler, radio, radio, surprising --
And if you can see one electronics store you can choose from this number of electronics from this number of electronics.
You can be six-and-half million different systems together, with parts of those store.
From focus -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young long ago, you could all be the phone services of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You were home the tackle of it.
And that was the same thing that it never catch the advantage of it.
And that time is forb.
Of course, there are a lot of different approach.
And in cellphones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-player, neush-player, and crisis and cry-break branding different.
And the Wellight this model in the store of the store of the store of his store.
The consequenc: people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question,
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do too much does.
And in aspects of life that are much more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more important than the attacks.
Gealth care, it's not in the U.S. is not as you go to the doctors that you have to go to the doctor, and that you have to doctor, and that you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and say, "We can do A doctor, or we can do Bray
A has this front of these animals.
And the brain has this front and nad?"
And you say, "Dokter, what do you find you?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front, and the engineering and the environment.
What you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was you?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you me."
And we call that "own inbrings of the patien."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision, which is a lot of decide of things -- the doctor -- to a liked, somebody who are seet, somebody who is free and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient of deaths -- the patient memorial is frequire a lot of advances much advances a lot of advancision,
Good described that ners, because the goality group, you can't buy and I cannot buy to buy them.
Why do it reclaim -- if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are going to think that we are going to be able to ask our doctor's to ask that other market away to make sure that other market away to ask that other market away to make the next morning.
Our identity, yet a price, equipment of us is now overnight, as you can see on choices, like you can see.
Our identities of our identities of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we just want.
Everybody morning at the time you have to think about what you want to be thinking, what to person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There has been a time that free everybody else there automatically from the same thing that you could be soon as possible, and then as possible.
The only real choice kid was with why, not when and what you were doing was what you then did.
Now free everything for the opportunity for the operate.
I teach lesson at particularly intelligent students, which I give twintive percent of the househwork than earlier.
They are not dommer or air or air than in the early time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Don't I married or now?
Or do I wait? Do I first children, or a care?"
These are all the way of questions.
They go through to answer they have an answer to them as it means they don't get their househ.
And they have right. They're important lives.
And then we come to work. Carl gave all of that technology is able to work every minute of every minute of every minute of every day.
There's one place one place, which I love secret that I love the WiFi does it.
I don't think that because I want to keep that place for myself.
But good, who are huge choices of work in that we are getting working on the time, at time, at time, at time, at time, or we go to work, or we are going to work, or not.
We can look at a football of our son of our son on the one side, with us on one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and we can see our laptop on the other side,
And even if they all get out of the write of that we are all the time of the Withm with all kinds of questions, "Am I responsibilit?
Am I reacross this emailing respons? Am I write this letter writing write of this letter --
And even if the answer is "Nee" is, we experience the football of our son in a very different way.
Where we also look at the big, the small thing, the dynamic things, living is a question of choose of choose of choose of choose.
And this is how the world was used to be there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose of choose choose of choose of choose.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad it?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
And the huge choices has two effects, two effects, two effects, two effects, two effects on the human beings.
A very contradictouched is that it fairly earlier.
And with so many choices people find the last.
I give you a very dramatically example, a research of investments in voluntests in volunted.
A colleague of me had been access to investment data from Vanguard, a big policy created conversation with about one million employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 vestments.
They discovered that for every tenes of policies that for every 10 policies that the worked far two percent of the work-in-malized both of the took two percent of policy.
And in fifarmed five-farmed papers with five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five or five farms.
Because it is a lot of physicians so difficult to choose that people are just exposed to the next day, and that they just exposed to the next day, and so on.
And of the exist.
That doesn't mean that means people after their pensionation doesn't have any dream bread, because they don't have enough money, but also that the choice knowledge was so harmly so hard was so hard that they have been working for it.
And they were going to have to 5,000 dollars a year,
The work-farmerly to doubled their own contribute to double.
So many of choices can be lost a lot of choice.
And I think the world is that the world is looks like this.
If it goes to the century of the century, you want to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be repulled with the wrong funds, or even the wrong threat.
And that's the first effect. The second effect. The second thing that we had the laming of our dish and choose the laming of our dish and eventually are the result than it would be if we had had a less options had fewer options were when we had fewer optimes.
And there are more reasons for doing it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for instance, from tallowed to be able to turn that the choice.
You put you in a case, you know, a different choice would have been better choice.
This is drought alternative is going to get your spike of your choice.
And it says that the following of the choice of choice, even if it was a good choice.
And the more options are doing it is to easier it is to have unaway from the pipment of the geodd option.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave tomorrow of how often we depending on the things that we depending on the things that we depenedent them.
If you can intend to include many alternatives you all see the attraction of all alternatives that you determination that you describe your desire that you determination in the wall.
That makes you fewer task with the alternative that you have chose you've got to chose you've got it.
A example, the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the strettter of this example.
This is on a vaile in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive two-ond.
They are a beautiful strand. Straling weather.
Don't be the way to do it? "Don't be carry," thinks of that man, "It's augors.
Everybody in my neighborhoods in Manhattan is the city of the city
I could do my car for the door, for the door.
And he was two weeks to the idea that he was a great idea that he was a great parking place to a great parking parking a great parking place for a lot of parking place.
And substitutional cost of the entire that we have, even if we make a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
And the more possibilities are too attracky alternatives are alternatives.
And those presents are present to us as a substitutional costs.
Another example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Now, let's go on here and now for example, and you don't have to considered things that you have to considerate things.
Another point is that you with any choice other choices extent.
And all of that other has so attractive sides, which is the catches of which is tiny.
And then third is the escalation of expecially expected.
I came to this is my search for a new bridge for a new bridge of this new bridge for a new bridge for a new bridge for a new breed.
I almost always spirit is always spirit is said.
By work, there was only one kind of stuff -- and you bought that you bought the past, it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were incredibly enough and often enough and often enough and often enough and often enough waste, felt the bottom.
And after years I went to the store for a newway.
I said, "Day, I want to get a stuff, this is my me."
And the winkely said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit --
Do you or a crit? Wilt you were stone-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed?
Do you want to do a brid?
Do you want to get something expanding or fline, or flink out, and so he went through it.
I was talking about it. And I was talking about it. And I said, "I want the only joke that was the only joke that was the only one."
And so he had no idea which was there, and so I have an hours all the possible bly enabled all possible to adapted all the possible bly enoughs of the point of the bridal bridal bribs that was adapted an hours of which was aday.
And it was honest, I left the wincle eventually eventually with a excited bits.
I had better than I could do it better -- I could do it better do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Or do this to myself out of myself, I wrote a book of it.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of the choice, was that I started expecting to expect of a good spirit of a good spirit of a good spirit of a good spirit --
I started without any expectation, because I just started to have one kind of spirit knows
And then then there were different wars, and one of them would be fast perfect.
What I was bought was well-of--instant.
And so I read my greenhouse with my expectations, and that asked me telegment, and that asked me television
And the more possibilities people have to have more expectations they have to deserve about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means people are less task with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I talked about now.
In the real thing is about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse worse was worse to have a lot of surprising experiences.
In our modern society as well as a well-varing civil as perfection, but the best thing we can ever reach to what we have ever reached as we were expected.
Nonce we become surprise because our expectations, my expectations, are high and high high and high high.
The secret of happiness -- for this is that you are all the secret of happiness is not too much expect to be expected too much expected.
I want to do -- a little bit of a carbiographic element, I was married with a woman who is actually fantastic.
I didn't have a little bit of the packaged with less tacks.
But with less enough needs are good sides.
And finally, when you have a bad spirit like a bad spirit as there is only one kind of presidentify, you can deal your depends on your desire to ask you why you are inted.
The answer is that case is simple.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different jobs are available and you kill it turns out to fall, who is responsible?
The answer to do that, is just as simple -- that's the same thing.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different greents of different works to fale.
So if the people decided to take people and decide as the results of those decisions are good about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clinical depression of clinical depression of clinical depression of cissue.
A factor -- not the enge, but a significant factor in this explosive factor in this explosive suicide and suicide self-suicide experiences of their high expectancy of their high expectancy of their high-expect factor --
And if they try to explain to explain themselves, they give themselves the deaths of themselves.
So the nettoresulat is that we care about it, so we actually talked about it, but our bad and feel soil --
Another a contained together.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be aware of where is attained by everybody to where is attains.
But that's not.
It doesn't suffers a doubt that can choose better than not crossed than not caring that more choice.
There's a magic flourds. Well fluics. Well I don't know.
But I know that we are for long before we are doing the choices that choices us are well-well-behaviors of the choice.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best of the best we can keep the best of it.
The choices in instance industrialized countries is prevent from material overfluence.
