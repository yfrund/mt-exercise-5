Forig years I showed these two dia's to show that the pool, which was the pool, who had the last three million years of the vailable of the VS, with 40-percent of the S, with 40-percent cromp of the U.S.
But this particular is actually the first of this particular problebecause it doesn't have the didness of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice problem.
The ice of ice is in the North Pose is in a sense of the clopping of our global system.
It's called the winter and crimpt in the sense.
The next dia that I shows is a version of what the last 25 years is happened 25 years is happened 25 years is happened 25 years is happening.
The permanent is a touches in red.
You see, you see, it from dark blaw.
That's the young ice ice ice ice in the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer in the somer.
The so-gent mess, five years or older older is almost like blood is almost like blood, that from the body is soil.
In 25 years is the way from this to this is going to be in this face.
And that's a problem because the fror because the North IJszee IJszee IJszee IJszee Ictually love woman, when the death, when the death, when the death, when the death,
Comber with the totale amount of atmosphere, that would be defining in the atmosphere, that could be be doubleing the entire of the atmosphere.
In some of some of indiepe in Alaska religious of methane in the water.
And then then the winter Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of Alaska different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different higher of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the Univer
Whoo! It's OK. The question is echer or we will be that will be there.
A reason for there, is that this huge of blace bron" Greenland from the noords of the now.
This is a smell twater at the
The water volume is echer than it.
This is the Kangerlussize in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea lot of style because the landscious, it's the place where the sea place where the sea place where the sea little bit of the sea.
These stroming these stroms.
And then the other side of the planet on the South Pole, becomes the largest of the planet.
And then maand rapped scientists scientists that it's very continent now a negative ive of the entive sbalance balance.
And in particular specific is the ice of the South Pool is very quickly about smelts, with name of the water-ending water-eiland-foot of water-eiland-a-ended enter-specific is very quickly about the squate.
The whole continent to six meter seespearing of seespearing is just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the on two after the size masmassmass, there are new now, which is a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of his dreinquate.
In the Andes, is this glester the brother, the brother of the city of drinkwater for this city of drinkate.
There are more stroyes.
But when they disappears,
In California was a reminder of 40 percent in the squark of the Sierra.
It's really really really in the water reservoires.
And as you could learn the predictions are the predictations of it.
This global has been done to has agree to a behavioral style of bossands.
And the number of course, about the world is speaking with a incredible and never never seen some of a sense of quickly and never never seen a lot of fail.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely unhold.
If you look at the way from a historic contexthan you see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton on CO2 degrees every 24 hours every 24 hours --
25 mites and ton every day in our oceans, Kook at the same time of the Stile of the Stillege of America, westing from the India, and in every single south of Indian subcontinent, there is a bigger in the ocean.
The only big war of the Earth, the only of the Earth, which is the desperation for 20 percent money is to 20 percent of pictures of pictures of picture.
Oil is a problem, and steenge is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extens, soters, so-sized up with China.
And there was a present to build a lot more city-carbon centrales of building cool.
But we see a bommace.
These are the city's carbon which the ban was annual numbered in the last last years, and where grow the last years, and where grow of alternatives.
There is a political streets of the glow-free-free-side.
The city-carbon and in oil industire gone of them from to to a single "scone" and the high of the demotor of the connection is a connection is a connection of them is a connectistate of them is a consistengineering for a lot of dollars to promotion, 250 million dollars of dollars to promotion, and the cooling of a lot of dollars of dollars
And that image to do something about that.
And the guys was there in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally city.
You probably see the news of the news of the news of the news
This is the one after one after one after the size of America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the advertising lines of the steendge of the Kerst was dead.
Video: ""Frosty the city's coolman is a stage of cool,
He's flowing up here in America, and he care here in America, and he cars for that our economy grow.
Frosty the cities.
He's paid and shapes and working works, and working."
Here is a big particular particular in West Virginia from the West Virginia of day.
The largest minitial is the big batch of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship is "Laat me be Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rewell, Harry Rewon't know where they talk about engineer."
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimate,
This is a piece of a lot of it.
And Video "Bue COL, we see the climate change, as a serious dreamount of our things.
That's why the reason why the reason is to give us a gigantic behavior to give a gigantic to the light and the destop of the value of cities.
Feit is, of course, not smart.
We find that the scree is -- and it still still still a craise to be a couple of cook.
So, you don't make you not make a climate change.
Let that but about us to gover.
Video: Acteur: Schone city, you have heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern cooling cool.
Fantastic! The machines make a little bit of laww?
But that's the happiness of scale of scale of scree technology.
Our dance the fact that the felt of cities of cities of the most important ways, the most important of the Earth is changing the opportunity of the Earth is scending the major cooling technology that you see here is all the time.
Look good around the scale of cooling technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally the positive alternatively in our economic challenges and that that on the area of national security.
Video: Stem: America sell of crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the climate crisis.
The rock wireless is our dependence of pictures of picssil fuel of phossil fuel and heited oil and heathy oile of photograph of phased oile of phohossil --
But now there's a during new solution to do from this.
Fore America of 100 percent shapes of shapes of years.
A plan to get America to get to work, a plan that us is a plan that us and the operating of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth is a plan to be silled us and the opportunity to be sailer and the surface.
And so so we have a solution that enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Our took how to do
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Of course, it's going to give America to give America.
And one of the speed ways to make a enduring to our dependence of old fuel fuel of old fuel that our planets to help our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
And then you have to create some of them to create good paid to create good paid to create good paid to create good past.
Stem: Repower America. Tike to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is a old African old African argument says, "If you want to be everyone.
If you want to go to coll."
We have to go far far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Forig year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I love the back to a cut with a update about how that machine works.
So here I'm going to be a lot of those who don't have not waren: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment has ever been educing in enomb.
It has to be the enough to nabsolutions that were desisted less than a billions of second after the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of second.
Enorm ambitious.
This is the machine is the machine of Geney.
We took pictures of those less Big Bangs in detectors in detectors and this is the ATLAS detect -- 44 meters -- 44 meter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in attacular so you can see the scale.
And at 10 september years, we put the machine for the first time for the first of the first one.
This picture was called ATLAS.
And that carefors for a feestern in the controll.
It's a picture of the first particle that are very task that helped around the LHC ging, and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which was working in the detect of the LHC,
In other words, when we had to do that picture on 10 September September we knew that the machine is a huge government is a huge govern.
I don't know if this is the largest across or this, when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet pages and saw that the Internet pages in the Internet pages in the Internet pages in the same of so.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific as a scientific impact of the scientific as a scientific impact of the scientific as a scientific impact of impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, what to do with these golds.
And they were battacked 13 thousand crather when the machine at the powerful powered to followed power.
The engineers under you will say, "Not value. It's small the behavior."
They can do because they do that, because they are superidend to very low-temperaturs.
So on min 27, couple of the space between the stars, which can be behaving stingle that are away that are away that are away that are adaped the bird of the stars,
In one of the connections between the nexts of the nexts in the LHC, sat a LHC, sat a Sat a SShe sat a constructify of the next.
And then the wireless was something blace, and there was an electrical weird to be a thousand camps.
This was the result.
This is another pressuppressing if you realize that magnets more than 20 ton weather, and they were about 30 centimeter and they were going to be placed about 30 centimeter and they were going to be placed in the magnets of them were going to be a lot of the magnets of them than 20 ton of the magnets of them are going to be a lot of the mag
We civide about 50 magnes.
We had to do them out of stories, what we did did it.
We all took them all took them at the time.
Now they are back on wead.
Eind mics will be the LHC againt.
We will be able to go and we expect members in you, or right or right or right or right with the cheap, so we can go to expect the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, they have insounces the debate of scientific research. It's easily to be easily. It's easily.
I think it's so hard to be so hard is so hard to be more than to be more than the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, dester of the value of the value of the value of his life's living to be explaining his teaching experiments of his teaching for the human consideridence of human minds to be that our imagineering for the images of the human beings are not a great great great definish.
Thank you.
I would want to start to ask up with you back to your children at your children when you play.
When you discovered how you had to do to graps, they were going to have to learn and wood, you know, you know, you were trying to learn with the enters, and the hand, and the hand, and the hand,
Rimtely insight is strong to be understand the world to understand the world to understand it.
If a information of inspired by the physical interaction with physical interaction with objects -- and with my advise Pattace and my medical and my medical Jeein of Kalanithi -- what we would use a computer of the engineering of the engineering of the engineering of the individuals that are a kind of individual rebitation that we can be a blapyzzzing the individual of information and we can reach the physice, with the information with the insponds of information with the inspions of information of information of information of information of information of information of the inspithi -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and then I have a computer that that that that that
and you can have to be ordering to the
This is asking us so become so so we decided to look at a answer, by the building Siftables.
Cort collaborate is a Siftable computer is a couple of a cooky.
They can be able to be pacting with the hand they can feel detect detect and they are wireless and they are wireless and wireless and wireless and they are contact.
The nuclear beginning is the physical handle blocks like blocks like blocks like blocks of them can be able to graduate it.
And in the flows are Siftables a example of a new ecosystem for the way,
And so this hulple of physical different, are more physical different, and even of their movement and even of the way we are moving them moved, there are different new and some of interactions.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable to tell a video to tell a video to tell a video and other single and other single towards and other single casifttable to play a lot of the crazy.
These interactive portraves, are conscious.
Indians are placed each other, they will be interest to each other.
If they are working on beard, they can be able to be some single this and what single is beautiful.
And they feel movement and doing.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction, the use of these interaction, the use of all, the use of all, as it was a low-like the crows.
In this example stells three Siftables of employing, and I can use them to use small in a lege of a lege of a lege of a lege of a lege table.
If we have been survives, we went back to the back back back what we went back back to the back back to it.
There are some of crippearing for the education, predictly, predictly, mathematics and logics that we want to give things to promess, and the result of the possibility and the result of the enterminate of the enters.
Here's the ton I -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci by a simple reigual reprogram.
Here we show a spel that a cruising between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of them are going to get in every Siftle, and sense of the Siftable, and send the wordbook.
After about 30 seconds is very require, and different, and different, a new series of a particular entertered possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to make it out of the slowed them and make a video of them and make a video of them and make a video of them and make a video of them and make a video of them and make a video of them and make a video of the Media Lab, and I have a video of them and
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these accessizing is that people need.
All of what you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know what they have to do to do.
Here are some other people to testing the tests.
That's our boy's board's tester, right?
And if he looks like he was just the Siftles.
For it were only blocks.
Here is a interactive painted paint.
We wanted to be a platform for the teaching of language.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can bring new carracters in the scene of the Siftable with that carakters of the table.
Here he lead the sun of them up.
Video: The sense.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Goed though, righ!
Do the scue of Siftables and the narakters and the name of the carakters with each other, and the narakters with each other.
DM: and so his own story of tell you of tell you
Video: Hel!
DM: It's a story with a poem.
and he decided how it looks like it.
Video: The cat fly fly fly
DM: The last example that I'm going to show show Is a synthesizer and likely music and likely -- where every Sifttables and pressing a sound product like the lead, and presses.
Eengineering 4, in which you can do you want to use what you want to use what you want to use to use what you want to use to use a different variatives,
These happy're injected in Siftables are injected so you can certain the pattern itself.
You placed a sound in the pattern by the attace of a lege Siftable effects of a lege of the entire effects of the ents of the enter-available effects of a low-a-engineering engineering in the pattern of a lot of of the pattern of the patterns of a
They're going to be able to a sound and and attacked by can.
Some of the general effects like tempo and volume that are access on the whole pattern.
Let's look at least
Video: DM: We begin with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern.
Now I place I do the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline
Video: DM: Now I feel a little bate.
Video: Then now, I'm going to heavy the filter of the presses, so I can be interested to be interested in the effect of the pressed of the pressed of the filter of the flows.
Video: DM: I can make it very quick it through the cancer of the tempo of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now copy I think about the bas for some more expression.
Video: I can reach the pattern of the pattern of the power.
So I don't have to be everything to plans, but I can make provision, but I can make very long and make a very longer and make it very long and make a little bit of a lot of the point of it and make a lot of the point of it.
And in the end of the dimmms of the dimmbers of the volume of the volume of the volume of the equal to be able to the cope.
Thank you.
As you can see what is going to make a passion from new peop-computer interfaces that are some interfaces that are some some of interfaces and body working and body working and body working and body working and body working and body working on the way our brains and working on the way our brain and body working on the way our brains of the way our brain
And today I had to show you one new election in this design design in this design areas with some some of some of possibilities that we developed in the lab.
The dad I want to bring about is that this only the attace is just the attace of the interacting of the interacting of digital media, which is the information of the world as we want to bring the information as we want to do it.
I dance you from heart.
I look at the way to talk to you to talk to you all the way to talk to you to talk to you to talk about all of you to talk to you all of all of you to talk about it.
I'm writing.
But, writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life is I decided to write and I don't think that that will change that will change that will change that will ever change
And year there is something express happened in my life and careering in my life and career, which I had to see my work on my work on my work on my work to be able to be able to be able to be be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in my life and careering in my life and careering and careering -- and careering my life and careering
It started a book that I have been regs in a book of moire: "E, Biddle moire: Beminnen," which is very very in the world and an international existence and an international existence and an international existence of work.
The sequence is that people have to be contegetting me and always took me and always doing.
And so what -- getting it do!
People come to me and ask worrying "Ben you don't have to be able to be able to be able to eat me and you don't have to be easily to me and you don't have to be it?
You don't have to be able to be very living you writing very writing to write a book in the auicate where people will have to be lowing for warm.
You don't have there to be batt?"
Erunning stitute -- you know?
Of course, that would be very much. But I remember me that I was remember 20 years ago, I was a teener, I told that I was told that I wanted to become a teener -- I wanted to be a told me that I wanted to be a little bit of me -- I wanted to be a little bit of me that I was a told me that I was a teend, very much.
People said, "You don't have to get success that you don't have to get success to get succes?
You don't have to be able to deal for equipment that you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be entered by the entered of it.
You don't have to be your life to do about this work that you have to be something from a working of your building, and that you will be able to be able to be able to your build your building bitter-bitter-see?"
Is in that streting.
In the short comes to this questions on this this is "Yeah.
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that are enough that are enough to be enough to be enough that are enough to be enough to be enough to be enough that are enough to be enough to be enough to be enough to be enough that are enough to be enough.
All of all.
But I'm also a lot of other things bang, you don't know for all of other things are not really really really to everything.
For instance, and other engineering and other engineering things.
But what is writing writing to the last time that are angst where the angst of that are going to be from.
Is the ration?
Is it a logical that somebody is a job to be done to be working for the work on Earth are see?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the geestery, something that is something that is something something about some of people are not happen.
Take my dad. He was screen engineering engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that he was a crowed to him somebody who was not joying to him or he didn't have a job for a lot of it.
And so so that is "You're how is it with your chemistry?"
No, so it doesn't have not about it.
To fairly be: scree engineers have been able by the century of the century of the century crazy for stustuff for study mbers to be done of mess.
Scheat whate, which have kind of reputation.
Not only writing other creative people have been able to be the reputation of people have been able to be very instabiout.
Look at the grimming dogs under the most magnife of the 20th century.
For of them are often often often by their own across do.
And even those who doesn't have no self-moth, seem to be under their gave to be swell.
In the last interview for his dead said Norman Mailer: "Miler: "Miler: "Mile every of my books,
That's what to say about you about your life work.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at it.
We all heard it all of the first and have heard the shaped and it with the side.
The universe is that creativity is that creativity inlocal is that creativity is that a artistment is going to be read to engaged to be able to read to cellend.
So I want to ask everyone here today questions to ask that idea is life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it now, I'm going to think about it is not a pretty much at all.
I think of the weak of the shape.
And also even even dangerous of it.
I don't like to see that this century is so gars so gard.
We can creative gests a lot of better than a lot of better than to live.
I know that it would be able to me, in my situation, in my situation, to be to lifeed to those dark in my situation.
And this is the fase in the fase my careers now in my career.
Go but after you took me me a saying,
I can have been four decades to be four decades.
Hoose is probably going to be all the public of the outside of the outside of the work that is actually actually sequence on the outsider of the work is really successful book.
We are here with friends under each other, so I can be well: hope it is probably going to be a biggest success my largest success to be behind me.
Yempha, what a idea!
If you think about it is going to think for your your eyes to take a hours to be able to the body's odd to the vice.
So I don't want to do not.
I love me to love me with the work I love to work.
The question is: "Hoo?"
After long after long after I think I am to conclusion that I can just go through writing a psychological describe a psychological describe in the process in the process in the process in the process of build to the process of the conclusion of build to the conclusion of it.
I have to do a securious destate between mouse and between mitself and my survive and my survive and my survive to the response of the reactons of the reactons of the reactons of the reactons of the dead of the deal with response of the writing of the writing of the writing of the writing of the de
I have been able to do it for waying to ways to do that.
I'm doing in the history and I do do deep me in other civilizations to see or others to see or others to see or others to be able to help people to help to help people to help to help people to help to help with emotional process.
My search has been building me in the old Greek and Romens.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romen's old Greeks and believed people don't creativity of themselves,
And I believed that creativity was a goddling of a re, unknowledge of a re, to the ments and inknowledge and inknowledge and unknowledge of the didling of a god-far place.
The Greeks called this decisions of creativity "demons of creativity "demonen."
And in Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he
The Romening had a species.
And if you have to have been a considered creative memory is a geni."
The joy is that the Romenon with a genion, not a particularly piently.
In their policy was a geniiian editions of magic god-entitit that are remember of the ately.
A little bit like Dobs of the house of the house flows.
If the artists at the work was read the geniia.
On fact he gave form to work.
Brilliantant! That's precis! That's the dead of had, the psychological describe the psychological describe the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work
The artists was so in protection to be a lot of narcism.
If you wouldn't be worth to you wouldn't have all the eer.
Everybody knew that was a inso-geniiian geniiia.
You know, you have worked at your work is not only to you,
Everybody knew that you have a nogal inhange genion.
Lange time is that contemed how in the Wests creativity was described
And when the Renaissance, and everything --
There is a very new idea: the individual ments is the the individual point of the universe and making the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystic weazero-sings, invented from the godling world.
And that was the beginning of the rational house of the rational house
People believity that creativity of the individual fiddle fiddle of the individual found.
And for the first time in history, there was about artists to say they were a geniiian and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I have to say that I think I think I think I think I have to find that I think I have to find that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to find a big front of it.
To give one person, one single individual individual is that he or they have the securrent of the century of the century of everything -- that you have been doing all the godling of everything -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something --
Also, or you ask the sun in so.
Egos are resisted to gigantic provided to gigantic provided to expect expectations of prestates.
And I think this pressure has been made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists are made a lot of artists of artists artists of artists of artists has been made a lot of artists of artiststs.
If that is, and I think is the question, "What do is the question, "What do is the question.
Can we do this different different do?
Can we go back on a old bit of the relationship between the relationship between the ments and creative mysteri?
Maybe not.
Wellip we can make 500 years rational house not not undone in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of gars.
And you are probably in the audience of scientific people who are remember about the idea that felse is that far far with some of factors with some of factors with some of factors to inspiring high-temporing high-teming high-temporary deal with the work of the working of the idea of the idea that are people people who who are the idea of the things that else of the idea that are people who are the idea of the working of the idea of the people who are people people who
It doesn't seem to me that I'm going to get to get you in there,
And I ask me to be be a way to me.
Why not?
Why would we have done that couldn't do that?
It is just so much as much as much as much as a few other explanations of the totally improved in the creative process.
Everybody who has to try something has to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so that it doesn't have a creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process.
And that some of them almost paranormals.
I have been a great American animal American animals.
And they are very close in the nine. Her is very very writing to write the closed of writing in the neint.
She told me about her young on the path of Virginia.
Some of them when they heard the felt on the work, felt so, they heard a pull of the country.
It was so said then, as wwell, there was a big golf air.
And so, in the hot wave than the country to her across the country to her across the country to her across the country to her across
They feel that the founder her foods of foods and knew that her on that her at that time, but one thing to do to do to do for her life.
And they ring back to house, behind by the paper and they had to see as quickly.
When the close by her hund her ha slight of her hund to write the only chance to write the free of the writing of her ha single chances.
Sometimes they didn't quickly enough.
And then then it doesn't have not. But the crazy.
And in the way of shapes the close by her himself is about the field, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words, in her wor
And so there were going to do -- this is what I think I think the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the close to mist.
Then she was seen in house and paper and paper and shaped it by her himp her himp and shaped it by her him.
Juist at that moment she had a potlege of paking.
And with her other hand, so told me so, they told me the past of the air.
They paid it to his star in his stare, and it back in her body while she was a single of her body while she was writing it back in her body,
In those cases came up to the paper that in my sense of paper in the paper in the entire gord.
And when I heard that I thought -- what I was a way of creative process my creative process is a lot of creative process.
And this is not! I'm not a memory. I'm not not a medium!
I'm a mouse of a mous, which every day on the same time on the same time and shapes and transssh and transssh and transformed and transformed and transformed on the same time.
But even in that days I had to have a lot of experience I had a experience.
You will also be able to know it as you can have creative ideas in your operating ideas in your oprelationship from a brother, you can identifying from a brothern that you can identify.
What is that then for bron?
How can we use it without that we become that without of the word?
At a way that we well, for us to is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think about this is a musician of Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed it for a time magazzzero.
We had to gover.
Tom is a big part of his life is part of his life life has been been been trying to get the crazy artists that from all the major to get power in the inconnection that are trying to get the inconnection that are creative impulative in him of his sure of the degree of his face.
And in the ''d Tom what ruster is a little bit of the years.
And on a day he reach in Los Angeles about the quick and changed the process of the streedom.
And while he heard he heard he heard a fragmentous of a melodie.
The decided of him, like inspiration that is doing, well.
It was a beautiful melos and he wanted to fashthend.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper at the paper at a tperiod.
The whatever exciting spanning from the hemelt of hemelos that case and then staying, and then it stayed me equires me equips.
I'm not good enough."
He didn't have a little bit not in panic, but he stop strong process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry you don't heard that I don't see that I don't see that I sat the stud?"
"Do you really really writing a lower of you can writ?
If you really want to be able to come later you have to do later later if I have to do that, I have to have time for you have.
And not, you don't have any different of falls.
Ga neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And from that point is lose the process of them very others.
And the work is the same thing with the dark of dark in the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of
But the sware spanning that creative process in him represents of the geniian when he distantial of the geniiion.
The geniy of it and lever, and lever, and lever, but cell.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go to to go to go.
It could be a wonderful arre working together, a kind of conversation between Tom and the propertent aspect that not really really about Tom and the propertil.
And that story has changed.
I have been doing a profites of getting in it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddle -- Biddle -- Beminning
And in a giving point I in desperate in the animals.
You know that you don't want to do but not good and you think it's a terrible ramp of the worst book. The book of it. The book of it. The book it.
It's not a bad bad of bad is really different.
I wanted to do it all project to do you all the project.
And when I remember Tom who who who who who who who who who who is going to way.
I knew I knew me from my manuscrips and founded me to a very single of the room.
And I said, "Luister ding, we know while, we know everything that if this book is not just brilliant to me, it's not only by me.
You can see that I have to have everything in what I have in me.
And I can't feel it.
If you find that it has to be better than you have to do you, you have to do it.
Snap you don't do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that.
I just writing because that's not not a little bit of my work.
Oh, and in the notulles are going to be a lot of them are just a differently.
Ta--- Unerable, the way the here --
Eums, and ago in the North African w-African wrong people to thank you to have a maance to dance maance in the heavy music.
Uren and hours and high-glors.
And that was always wonderful, because the dance of professionals.
But some of some of echecher something for some of it.
One of those dans became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know what I mean, you ever ever seen to be seen something in a performer.
It was as if the time was ilstood and the danger, and the danger.
And he didn't did nothing else than the thousands night, but now now now everything is together.
As he doesn't have to reach it not only a humans.
In him, under the him of him.
A godly free sophim.
If something that happened to happen, people what it was Dan people what it was Dan to clah, and sheat and cut to rop and shear, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because that was it was for them.
Tried storical fact, a leut, a left historical face: When the Moren Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanish South Spanu Spanu South South South Spanu Spanu Spanu
The extent is echer by the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah." "Ol, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ololen."
And you have to have the day in the way to be securvates, and flaments and flaments and flaments of the day.
If a artists in Spanu or magical or magical does, you ropt people's food, "Allah, OK, Allah, OK, Allah, wwell, th, bololen."
Our understanding -- a glimp of God.
Presisted what we need.
Lasty is eching the next morning the next morning to the next morning to the followed of 11 hours in the morning to be no godly.
And at that moment he is a little bit of a little bad with low-foot of them will never be able to come to be more to be high to come to be a lot of them will be going to come to be a lot of the parents of parents of the well.
Maybe there will never be somebody else will be somebody else in the dance.
What does it now he has to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really hard to sell craping for a creative minds for a creative mind.
But so pinally not to be not to be to be not to be it.
Imagine you don't have to be extraordinary that the most invited of your person from your person from your your person from your person from your person from your your person from your your person from your person of your person of your person of your person on of your person of your person of your

And so you know, cancer everything.
I have been doing in the middle of the daad of that days.
The last months I've been working on a book, that will be different. The book that will be different. It's a book where a lot of requires that is chooking a book in the last months is chood.
The operating of that illuster present present present of that illuster pregor.
If my days with me to the hall, I love me to be the same predict of the same pres: You know, you don't have any of the same thing.
You just just you work.
You just just do you do this, what it's also is.
If you do do to thank you.
If the godline that you is to be able to decided to your work on your work on at your work on at the work on the wonderful brother, "Oly!"
It's not not to be not, dance than you won't be too --
And also thank you "Oly!"
I believe I believe that I believe
"Olen!" "how to do you have a lot of purpose human love and propertability to stay plum.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I had been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and discovering of new sets of genes.
We actually started to be a new point, we were the biology to the biology of the biology of the digital code to a new fase in the biology of the biology of life.
So we always have tried to be trying to ask the big question.
"What's living is something that I think about a lot of biolos have tried to understand in different levels of bioloss.
We tried to have different different approaching to less components.
We're now now now now about 20 years to the digitalism.
When we did the human genome we have sequenced the analoge of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of computer.
Now we try to ask the question, we can create regeneres, whether we create new life from this digital universe is to create new universe.
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome, with the smallest for a laboratory of that can be conmentation in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at a nice or we can come to a nice little genome of genome can come to be able to come up to a nice or we can get a nice to be a nature of genome we can get to a nature of it.
We can be in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or son, which are there there are there.
But if we look at the metabolic cards, is that relatively relatively considered with the onze.
Gelmess, this is simple.
But when we can look at all the genes we can explore a piece of single that would be a living cell to be a living cell to all the cell of the cell of the genes that would be a living cell of the genes that would be a living cell to all the genes of the genes that would be a living cell to all the genes
We decided that the only roud of the only rout, to be this chromosophim to synthetisize the components to be able to be able to ask the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions to be able to ask the person to be able to be the couple this is a few of the most fundamental quest
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we started a chromosh synthetis?
Staat the chemistry it to make these very big molecules we never have have been going to have never seen before?
And if we can do that, a chromosophim "restarting "resee?
A chromosophim is just a piece of chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is destrainial on exponential evidence.
Our far to write the genetic code lose of sone, but is a thish, but is across the genetic crazy.
And our last point it would put on this moment on this momential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were some city for a number of step, to begin with a bio-ethical ethical ethical across the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthese.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making to 50 letters in length and it's a lot of a degenerative process, so how long you make it more fold it is a lot of old you to make it more fold it.
So we had to do a new method for the society of these little pieces and the corrigate of all follows.
And this was our first poging, with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little four rus of that bacteria diad.
We designed the stuck of the stuck of the foutcorrections
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 literers.
The spanning part of the beginning when we started to chemical straining chemical stacross the bacteria and the bacteria and vironments and vironments are going to make a lot of gards and vironments are going to make a insists of the bacteria and we are starting a including of the bacteria sp
The vironal particles were losed in the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and doods.
I was insions in fact, I was talking to the oil industry, and I said that they model to well.
They laught more than you low.
And so we think this is a situation is where the software are own hearth of the software can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of greater to grow something larger of grows.
We wanted to build the ential bacterial chromoses.
That's more than 580,000 litters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetts in cassetts -- so we could pull the cassetts --
to understand what the deal components of a living components of a living cell.
The design is critical is critical and if you beginning with digital information in the computer than that has to be very accuster than that are very accuster than that are very accustaccure.
When we first for the first time we had been society in 1995 was the standard precision one far of 10,000 based.
And so we could be able to be able to 30 followed 30 followed the original sequence than it was not in the original sequence.
And the other part of the design of studying studf that are 50 letters to be survive to all other stuffs to all other stuffs to build small the other studying and we have to build the design that we have to build the design that we have to build up together to build the design of these are going to build up up and we can be able to build up up up to
We design design in fact, we are inside.
Maybe you have been doing that, we stop in strong.
Bedit: we have a four of genetic code: A, C, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters cos for run 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple of them is a simple to every aminozeroxygen of the aminozerozur.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write, in fact,
Aantly, we just just just melt to be just mous.
Some of them were teleurgested that there were no dished.
We have these pieces of stuck that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are some of them who they reach reparts and they see.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces of studying with studying five to 7,000 letters and you have seen up and you have to do pieces of 24,000 letter, to 7,000 literle.
In every city we crowd a survey of these stuck stuck so we could sequences a process that we want to create a process -- that you will have a process -- that you can see the straks of these stuck is going to see a process of these stuck ck of these studie.
We try to do it from automatisissue to do it.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And so we get to come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 based, they don't have to be so easy more in E.
And that is the exercising of all modern tools of the modern biology.
And we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombined that is used by biology to repaid DNA to repair DNA reparently to food.
Here is a example of it.
There is a organism of Deinoccus radiodurans radiodurans that three million radiation of radiation to can.
And you see in the following pane; my chromosophim just from each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he was a took it in the other, precised of the first of the first time
There are thousands of organisms that around.
These organisms can be very sun-dred to be very slipped.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there is life in the space can prevent that can be preciate environment, a new aquatically environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is a lot of course, there is a lot of the thing is there there are a lot of it.
Here is a very extraordinary microph of the molecule that we have made with these processes -- facial with the right of the case of the studying design of the studying design of the studying design.
And so that they have to free it causes of food.
This is not a electronen-microscope photograph; this is a traveled microscope.
It's a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audience we explaining inside the audience.
This is more than 580,000 litters at genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of people ever ever made by people, with a duidal structure.
The molecule is more than 300 million.
If we would pend it with a 10-points litere, without spending the genetic code is 142 page of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the depengugugue is a pressed.
Good, how do we starts a chromosophim? How do we have we go? How do we have we go?
It's a four rus is the clearly is a clear.
It's a bacteria is a lot of complicity.
It's also simpleer if you give you euckaryos, like eukaryots, like wishhing the celkers and do, and that is what you know if you know if you do it as the cloud.
And in the bacterial is the chromosophim integrated in the cell, but we have integrated that we have a complete transpline that we can have a complete transpline of a cell transpline of a cell to a other, and the actives.
We have a chromosed of a micromosed of a micromosed species.
These are about as far as far as people and mics.
We foot what extra genes so we could select for this chromosing for this chromosing for this chromosing for this chromosing for this chromosh moso.
We have the contemped with enzyming all the egs to make all the equips.
It was women, in the cell when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be the very avanced -- the new chromosophim in the cell.
We even thought he would come to talk about it to about it to be a process what is removing it to developed the process of the process of them to developed it to be a lot of it.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of these kinds of chromosophim have been taken in a third of daan, where they have thousands of daan, where they have been able to foot the species.
People that evolution is present to have a lot of biology is not a lot of biology is not a lot of biology crazy.
There are enzyms that restricti-enzymed enzyms that are actually called DNA veryverymists.
The chromosed that in the cell was not easy.
The cell -- the chromosophim we stop in the state.
It was expressive, and the recognize the other chromosophim as strange of the purpose, and so so we had the cell with the new chromosophim.
He was blue from the genes we had stop the genes we had stop it.
And in very short time dwents all the carakististics of the ene of the species, and changed he has been in the new software that we had stop in the cell we had stop in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell time and changes that we had sted in a very short time and changing the cell time of the cell time and change.
All eggets changed to changed the genetic code -- when we had the genetic code -- it was changed.
This is making a clink of genomic, but we are in the state, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamentally DNA, to change things fundament.
Good, I have been payer to pay this is not a scree -- this is present -- this is preciation of evolution, and I have been payful for a new version of the Cambrbranch of the Cambrbrick of the Cambransion, where there are a big new species of scaled in factorial new species of the Cambrbranch of the Cambrand,
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty much as you need to look at what you need to what there's a lot of it.
We're going to go in the fact of ses-half to 9billion people, during the next 40 years.
To o put it in my contex, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for every of us who are in 1946, in 1946, in 40 years that there are four years that there are four there.
We have to have a food with food food of screen water, medicine, medicine, medicine, front of the ses-half billion.
And that's really really really really to do that for for for that.
We use five billion ton collects, more than 30 billion freedom.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in ogences in ogences or whatever is to replac; then it is going to be a huge challenge exist.
Then of course, there is all those carbon dioxide of the straining of the atmosphere.
And in all our worldwriting discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had but a dog of components, and look at the diversity that is present there is present that is present from there is present that is predicted there is present that is from there is present a different components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from a dog of different components, and you have a dom of the electronices that has been going to be in the diversity of a dom of the ppetttttttt
We are predicted by a biological reality and our except of the imagination.
We don't have techniques to thesemethods to do nothesemethods to do that combination genomics to do now.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes that can make a million chromosomes a million robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the required of 20 million genes of trying to do is a processing to optimalizing to make octon or medicine or medicine or medicine with a small team of the science.
And it's just a lot of selective.
We can select selecter for lives, chemical or brandstic or brandster producti, vaccinproducti, and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real design design is a real design of what we really work, so you really have to work on the computer and a new kind of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the real design of the computer of the computer of what is a little bit of the computer of the computer of the real design of the computer of the real design of the real design of the real design.
We don't know what it will be seen from it.
We know precising how their genetic code from disease.
We four fourth generation of fuel fuel of fuel future.
Our gone to ethanol of your face, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come from the inviting will come from the sugar, to more high and more more more or different different kinds of neighborhood or different kinds of neighbor.
But the only way we think that biology is big influence without the food price and the described and the described and the describe as we begin to be a lot of food as his food as his food and we have been able to design the way that we do the first of the first of the first thing that we do that the first four engineering for 18 monmonths and within about 18 monmonths and within about 18 months and within about about 18 monmonths and we think that is is a lot of the first of the demottttantangth of mainfood to have
And slip and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered discovered in the worldwell, we have other method.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lets in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, in coals, at coals.
It makes methending to CO2 with molecular waterst-waterst-water-food-free fuel of molecular as energy.
We are looking at the same thing we can take fast CO2 easily four easy to four pipes where that CO2 2 is re-fabring to brandster to brandster to brandsting this process to stop this process to church this process to cheas.
So in a short time we think we are thinking that we are able to do that we are able to do that is living to the basal question, "What is living in a short of life is living in a short of the basal question: "What is living in a short of a short of a short time we are in a short of a short
We have been a few of you -- you have the describe the petrochemical industry.
Yeah, if you can't do this at TED where you do it in TED
A important energy broke energy broad.
But we work on the way of these worth cools to be servaccines to think of these works.
This year, there was the floor, we always have a little bit more behind the faces of the feet of the faces of the feet of the faccine.
I think that can change that can change by the textane-combined vaccines.
Here you see how the future can go from the evolution, the evolution, the sure is changing the evolution with synthetic bacteria, and inventually eukarilta.
We are more far of people.
Our goal is certainly to make a cancers to make long enough to survive that well to do that well.
What I want to show you if you want to show is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to a sure to Microsoft is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment where you can have to be able to deal with immense of you can work.
We look at many gigabies to digital images and can be here in the way and can be here in the way and except and except the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts of the single of digital image and we can be in the sorts of the things and we can stay in the brain and we
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big this collections or images or images or images or imagination.
Most of these are normal digital camera photographs, but this is a smart of the Library or Congress, and sense in the 300 megapixel of the Library of the gapixel of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of Congres:
It doesn't matter because it doesn't matter because it would be influence to influence in a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen is a critical of pixels is a third of the screen.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a completely book, a example of not-image data.
This is the graue house is by Dickens. Ela colding pieces.
To evidence that it really really really text, and not a picture, we can do something that is really able to show that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange to read a book of a book of a book of a book of a e-book.
I wouldn't have to be many of it.
This is a realisticer example of the Guardian.
Each big image image is the beginning of a subject.
This is really gives you really see the place and the experience of a real paper or well-scree of the real paper or well.
We also have done something with the cording of these except of The Guardian.
We have a nep advertising of high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising of information -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information --
If you want to see the possibilities of this car and you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas as we can really make the constraints of treating the treats of treating four dependent of treating the screen to do that we can do the care of treating the care of treating the care of treating the care of treating the care of treats of treating the screen of treats that we can do the care really really really care of treatment to do that we can really do the care that we really really really really really really really really to do to do that we really can really do to do to do to do to do to
We open that this doesn't mean of means and other other means and other thirflaw -- not to be more more meaningful -- not need to be more meaning.
Of course, are agrands a for the hand for the past of a technology as dease, I will have a time to spending a time to spending a lot of time we can also have a lot of the felt of the deaths of the fellow of the dead.
These are all the weight in the U.S.
And then placed on a image of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who don't have two techniques are connected to each other.
A erature of Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer vision research, provening the University of Washington, aaid from Washington, aaid at U.Washing on University on U.Washing on University on University of University is a very beautiful extly of University in University of Washing revevement of the University reveveveveveveve
and Rick Srisci in Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is the U.S. It's mean of the cray.
When we do this do, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution experience.
The space shapes of the images of this meaning is meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images are building these images are building the real space -- the Grassi in the Canadian Rockish, where they are genomomes -- where they are the genomes of stabilized diashospike of the things are purpose of the things are phibited of the space.
I don't know if there is another time is another time is other environments to show you.
There are a lot of space, there are a lot of space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynthesize this sense of Photosynthess, to the communicate of the real power of the environment, in my head is the case of the environments of the environments of the environments of Photosynthess.
We had to reach with the advocates of advocating and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notrace Dame with images from Flickly Dame in Flicks, and you get you to get Notrack Dame in Flicks, and you get images of people in the hospital and the campus and the campus and the campus and equired the campus and the campus and the campus and you get out of the Notricky of the Notricky of the Notrackr.
And every of these oranches are a deal of this model that is a deal of this model of model to be part of this model of model of this model of model of this model --
And so these are all Flickr image things, which is in the way that are copyerat.
And we can shaped to figh the way to vigate it.
You know, I never had never thought I would never have to work at Microsoft would work.
It's survive here is so devices to be so forth.
I believe that you can see that many types of cameras is that many of gsm to spirirreflexing many of them are cluding a big number of them are cluding in this environment.
I'll try to find what strange is strange the images of the images
There are so many of them and the same thing and right?
Eries between this is even a series of pictures -- there are here.
This is even a poster of the Notrace Dame that is churposter is churposter is craped by the program.
If we have four four in far in a physics of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to do with social environment, this is using the data from the whole collective of the whole collective secrets of how to look at the fact, the Earth -- and heading the Earth -- and coping all of the other.
All these pictures are connecting together, and shapes a very little bigger than the songs of the dare.
You have a model that from the whole of the Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the Earth
This is a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the work of the work of the U.Virtual Aard.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it to use the present of the present of the people who use the use of people who use it to use the people who are used to use the people who are used to use the people who are using the people who are using the people who are using the people who are used to use the people who are using the uses.
Their own photos are present of metap-farmers that somebody else in the face.
If somebody would want to be able to do with all these healthy and their names, and then my photograph, my picture of the Notrace Did that I can use it to be able to be able to be a access to the space, and create that metaper of every photos, and creater of photos, and creating a kind of photographonal social social social social social social social and shaps.
And of course, it's product product of this is rich virtually model of any interest of every interesting place on Earth, who not only don't only from living photos, satelial images and other across and other access, but also from the collectively of the collectively.
Our tell-dances.

We find ourselves -- so often we want to do but we want to do but we want to do it.
Everybody otend to the sure you have to think what for person you want to be thinking for person you want to be thinking about person you want to be think.
Let's have it about the house is what the single is sin.
There is a time that free everybody else there is free that you get to be able to be able to be able to be able to children began to children began to children began to children begin to children began.
The only workly choice was not when and what you did you disapped.
Now free everything for the surface to the surface.
I evolved at at least students, which I was intelligent students, which I was evening less house work on the left of the people would be become more than ear.
They don't have been not dommer or or living in earlier than in earlier in earlier in earlier than living in earlier or living in earlier or living in earlier than in the earlier or in the early
No, they have the pressure with choices
"Do I wouldn't have not? Do I have to trust it?
Or will I wait? Nake I first first children, or a care?"
These are everything about these are questions.
They go through to them, if this means that they don't have to have a lot of work and therefully that they don't have a good case and therefore stories.
And they have very important life questions of living questions of question.
And then we come to work. Carl just just all of that technology is to work every minute to work, where the world is to work, where in the Randolph Hoteltel.
There is one place that I love love to a place where WiFi is the does.
I don't well, I don't want to keep that place for mitself.
But good, which is huge choices of work in that we are still working in that we are working on time on time and we are working on time or we are not.
We can look at a footbalaged of our sone, with us cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our Blackberry on the other can, and the way our laptop of the other off.
And even if they all from stome, we all every minute of those who are about all the way of those of ask: "Do I said, "Well, I think of this phone?
Do I writing on this emailtor of the brief writing writing writing writing writing writing on this issue is writing reager?
And even if the answer is the answer of the footbalth of our sonce of our sense of our son--foot balance of our song-footbaldy."
Where we also look at the small, the small, the small, the listening of choose is a crazy.
And this is how to the world there was going to be expanding the world
There were some choices, but not everything was a craswest of choose of choose of choose.
And so the world is now now now now now now now in the world now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad whether bad or bad of bad or bad of work?
The answer is: "Yeah.
We all know what is good to do is good about what is good to talk about what is bad is bad to it.
And that huge choices has two effects of two effects on the ment.
A very effect is that the first thing is that the first of beyond the bevices than convict.
And with a lot of choices people find find the laster to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically here is a very behavioral example of free plans.
A colleagues of the craised to investment in Vanguard, a big policy protected with about a million working with about 2,000 works,
They discovered that for every tions for every tions of policy that was far the worked are two percent of them were two percent of the worth of the work.
If you are fifth foundations are less working on the five than five than five than five than five than five --
Because it is that the at fifth is so very very slow is to choose that people are just explaining the choice to the next day, and that people are the next day, and that are repulling up and so forth.
And of expose is coming from the point of exposed to be away.
And that doesn't mean that people who don't have to have no dry to eat because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to have enough money to have been so very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very distant to have been a lot of dead.
And they were songs to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose forwards a year to be in the nose of them in the nose of them in the nose.
The working about, the case to reach their own particular particular to be double.
So a lot of choices can be lose lower work.
And I think the world there is there,
If it to the century garness to you very foundation, you want to do very found?
You don't want to be sure with the wrong fone, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had to remove the loveral of us and cooping the devices and shaped to the result than the result than the outcome of the result than the sense of the result.
And there are meeral reasons for for to fear to feel
And one of that, there's that there is that there is in a choice, for example of tallowed to be perfect.
You make you in a sense of that would be a different choice to be behind in a sense of the other choice.
This is dream of alternatively to be be able to get your choice.
And then you do do deaed to the following of the choice of choice, even if it was a good choice.
How more options are easier to be easier to have to have the stuff of the crazy of the code of the code of the cost optial.
A second reason has to do with substitutions.
Then Gilbert gave morning to how often we do the value of things that we do do them on the things that we have to be exploring the things that we are going to be able to do it.
If you can indent, you can indent, you can see many of all the time you can see the attracy of all alternatives that you deal of all alternatives that you deal with the alternatives that you describe the quickly quickly the pultivate of alternatives that you can see many of all the alternatives you you can see many of all the
And that makes you less tests with the alternatively that you have to have shed.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the streck of this example.
This is on the way in the Hamptons.
They have a during second wone.
They sit in a wonderful strand. Stralend of a humans in fact.
Beter can not? "Don't do itself thinking gusty.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city of the city is the city of the city is the city
I would be my car to flaw my care."
And he seen two weeks to soke up with the idea that he was a great parking parking place.
And we have to have cost of the following of the following of our choice, even if we have a great choice.
How more possibilities are more possibilities to be more to be more to be able alternatives there are there.
And that presenting us as substitutions.
And again, a very example of image.
This imagineering stories about a number of points.
Like in the way, and now you have to government things not have to government.
As a point is that you with every choices of choices explor.
And all that other has been so deattrace to be several crazy to be evolved in the coods.
Ten third is the escalation of expecially expectations.
I came up to this is my square to a new benhouse.
I turn almost of always played to be bone.
And there was just one kind of play -- and that code you walk and that code you don't have the biggest totally unately uncomfortable to be enough enough and frow enough enough and froped enough and felt enough it to.
And then I went to the winke, I went to the winke.
I said, "Da, I want to have a speak of them, this is my too."
And the winkely said, "Wilt you smarter smarter or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Wilt you whether a rit? Wilt you have a rit? Whilt is or acid?
You have a bad of a bones effect?
Wilt you something explaining pipes, or flessing pip." And so he went to be to.
I was there to play from it. Na time to be said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to be the only bough."
He had no idea what bought was not a hours that was a hours all the possible birds of bongs to passion.
And so so I love lowed the winkes the winke, with a explored bity;
I had been done to be better than all that possibilities I could do it.
But I don't feel to feel me better.
Why? Om this to explain to explain to explain a book a book.
The reason I don't feel better feeling with all that choice, I was a more expect of a good speak of a good spease.
I started to expect without any kind of speaking but I think of a kind of spease.
And then there are different wars, and one of them would be free perfect.
What I was a bought of a lot of good -- but not perfect.
And so I expect my benough with my furbing with my farmers, and that powerful cally.
How more possibilities people have to expect more expectations they have coosting about the surprising of that possibilities.
And that means people are less tests are more than the good results are very good results of the good results are good results.
Marketings people know this not.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about it.
In the really is about this.
Everything was bad everything was bad was a bad was better.
Because when everything was bad was people to have to have a lot of people have been going to have to have a lot of experiences.
In our modern society, we can we be as welvarious citizened citizened citizened what we can ever be able to be able to be a good as well as well as well as well.
And then we ever describe be be expectany, because our expectations, and my expectany.
The several of happiness -- for this is not to be a lot of happiness is not to expect a lot of happiness is not to expect a lot of expectancy --
I want to have -- a car -- a car biographic elementous -- I was a woman who really really really really really really fantastic is a woman is a woman who is really fantastic electic element.
I have to have a less tested with less tested me with less tested me with less tested me with less tested me with less testend.
But with less enough to be good cants.
And so so you sit is a bad of the spark of the spark is just one kind of present is a kind of present is a kind of present to you ask the intests of the wrong is that you are the inted.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. We don't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bones are available to fall, and you cooping it is a single that is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple is so simple.
You had a better choice,
With hundreds of different bones to faling a single to fales.
So if people decided to take up with the results of those decisions are good to be good to be good to be good about their choice.
And that they take themselves.
In the western society is four clinical depression of the young garent.
A factor -- not the one of factor -- not a significant factor in this explosion, in this explosion, is that people are so often in the factor -- it's really really depression to expect their high-expectances of their high-expectations.
And when they try to do that teleuring for themselves, they give themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettorulate is that we speak is that we seen objectively, but our bad of fellow feeling of it.
As a society.
This is the official dogma, that is by everyone for where is going to be able to do for where is going to be able to be able to do for where is the official dogma,
But that's not not
It doesn't have a two-seeing that can be better than not a little better than not a coose of it is not cartomatically that more choice,
There is a magic foundations of choices that I don't know.
But I know that we have long long before we have been able to be able to be able to be able to be forth.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best of the best to keep the best of it.
The choices in industrialized countries is going to be flowing from material is flowing.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard about it, where the problem is not so much choice, but it's not a lot of choice, but it's really really choice.
So the paradox that I speak to be here with name for the moder, which is what is to provided West.
That's frustrength and you have this crass: Steve Levitt you have gistered to told that you have to have children are not helping children don't have to help children are not helping your money.
I saw you the same about this dure, insquare completely complicated choices -- they don't have to do now.
They make us lives less value.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all these choices where people have to have been sure to make people in the life of that people have to be living people on the predictions.
And in fact, you would be able to be on it.
That's what economs is what economists is called a Pareto-a-a-a-a-regular ax.
Everybody is better by reverse of what farmers -- not only arm people -- and that comes to be people -- and that comes through the last of choicicity that we are with our behaviors.
And so so if you are too too you read as a developed story is saying, "Ach, what does does that fish is there to be fish it.
Nothing is possible in a visu."
A scral imagination, a shortise world, the world-wring world-wried.
But how long I think about it.
Because in fact, there's this to the hand: If you have the fishing to make possibilities to create possibilities to create possibility, but you have no free to create a free of the brain is to the fish of the brain is to the free of the craise to create possibilities to do not a free-free-ffish fish of the
If you are the visions to create the way to create possibilities to be less testranges.
It lead to more lower and less testing and less testing and less testent.
Everybody has a visual sense.
This is free sure is very free to be even for the fish, but certain for us.
But the desister of a particiar visial visual visions to be asking about, insil.
Thank you for your attention.
