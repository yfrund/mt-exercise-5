Last year I showed these two slides to show that the Poice cap, who was the past three million years of the size of the vastant was about the size of the United Statand of the United Statand of the United Statand of the United Statand was was going to show you the size of the United year year and the size of the day's year and the pool,
But this is actually the first first of this specific problem because it doesn't deal with the ice:
The ice skap on the North Pole is in a sense, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It turns out in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide that I show is a crowd version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent, the permanently purpose of the permanent.
As you see, it out of dark blue.
That's the year, that's the who's winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called permanent, five years or older, or older, is almost like blood that is from the body.
In 25 years of this is going to this forward.
And that's a problem because the frozen frereached the North Icely, and there's a very large amount of frozen woman, and there's a very large amount of carbon is that when it meth, when it meth, when it meth,
Consider the amount of discontention in the atmosphere, that could be double that amount that amount that amount if we describe the remaining point when we describe the remaining point to the amount of disposal amount of the atmosphere.

Whoo! She's OK. The question is right.
A reason for that is that this huge is that this huge called Greenland from the north of Greenland from the north of the north of the north of Greenland from the north.
This is a meltwo-atriver.
The water volume is echer than equivalent than equatic
This is the Kanger-lussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea is because it lands because it landyes, it's the place where it comes into the sea.
These are flow out of these are going to take a little bit.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, invents the biggest ice mass on ice mass on ice mass on earth.
Again, the last months reported scientists that the whole continent now that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole is very quickly to the melting, with name single underwatering a few underwaters.
The whole continent is to six meter sea single stying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the on two after largest ice ice mass, there are new now, who are now new mers, who was still glaciers --
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water is the meltic water.
In the Andes, is this garly the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more strobs.
But when they disappears disappears to drink water.
In California was a reducation of 40 percent in the snowwwall of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions are requires.
This global dream of drought has read to a dramatic styers.
And the number of nature, and the number of of nature, with an incredible and never seen in the world has never seen seon-speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years, in the prevented 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping bable.
If you look at it from a historic context of a historic context of what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 across CO2 every 24 hours.
25-mioton every day in our oceans, look at the eye area of the Stille in the United Stille of the Stille Exian area of subcontinent, there's a behaviors of Indian ans.
The only big cause of global warming, the earth, next to deforest, which is 20 percent of the earth, is burning to be disilluminations.
Olie is a problem, and steengineering is the very biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest excites, together with China.
And there was a propose to build a lot more coalaxies of building centrales.
But we see a circle.
These are the crossons of coales that the building was annumber of the bunch of alternatives were repowered to the bigger alternatives were forget
There's a political fightful on the gang in our country.
The urban carbon and oil industire industire for 250 million dollars to promote "scale coal of coal coal coal of oil --
And that image was doing something to me to something like this.
Round the urban was at me in Tennessee, about four billion literally crops four billion gallers check model.
You probably seen it in the news.
This is the biggest dish of the biggest dissease.
This happened to the Kerst.
One of the advertisers, and the supply slip are around the Kerstrong was this:
Video: ""Frosty the steengineered is a stay up, a stage, really, refrigeration of the challenge carbon man.
He's overfluenced here in America, and he makes our economy.
Frosty the urban carbon man, with the day.
He's paid and estimate and employees their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia of Virginia froms.

Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be, Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know where they're talking abou."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on the too.
This is a piece of one of them from a one.
Video "But, COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat for our things.
That's why the reason the reason is the most important goal to give you a giant improvement to required to the light and bring the light and the lose of truth about stead.
Fit is, steengineer is not smart.
We find that it is shaped -- and it still still still still work.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me show you all over.
Video: Acteur: Schone steencarbon, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shows that hypermodern shocools centric centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are making very what is noise.
But that's the sound of shock technology.
In dance the fact that the breaking of the most important causes of the most important causes of global warming the Earth, the remarkable thing that you see here.

One of the fastest ways to make an end of our old fuels that dependence of old, they burned our planet fuels that our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
And then you get to to create good investments to create jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African talking word, "If you want to be says, "If you want to be all of it.
If you want to go far far together."
We need to go, and faster, and faster.
Thank you.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I reward to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am the ones that don't waren: the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever underneath the biggest scientific experiment ever in the enters.
It has to be the circumstances that were dealing the universe was less than a billions of second after the universe started to be 600 million times a second times a second times a second.
Enorm ambitius, dy!
This is the machine Geny:
We took photos of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in the scale.
On 10, we put the machine for the first time we first put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
And that causes for a partment in the controll.
It's a photograph of the first particle that was all around the LHC went around the LHC went around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, valvalue by the LHC, who were flolowed by particles in the detect of the detect of the LHC.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine worked on the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the biggest strange, or thing, or thing, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page out of the past as it looked like this.
That means we made a cultural as a cultural as a scientific impact --
A week, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make with these golden behaviors.
And they were 13 thousand amping a thousand amper when the machine works.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small the drad."
They can do that because they're superago, they can be superaged on all the low-to-low-test temperatures.
So on min 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can be shaped that shapes.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And it was going to be something warmer, and it was ineletric resistance against that 13 thousand ampeering electric resistance.
This was the result.
This is still impressive if you realize that that those magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of weay, and they were moving about 30 inches --
We were doing about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We all repairs.
Now they're back on road.
Eind maps the LHC will be again.
We will take it back and we expect it and we expected measures in junii or right and we can go to figure out what the building of the universe.
Now, of course, those are going to be reincidents the debate re-investigate research research.
I think it's fact that it's really difficult that we go further than the LHC. the value of things like the LHC.
I let me show the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would have been defined to define the value of his student, his learning was Michael Farase, this said, "Nons' is so dangerous, "None's dangerous, "Non's images of human minird than to take the images of science than to take mysterios, that there are not a new world's natural world in the forests of natural world in the world.
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you to ask to your children at your children at your children at your blocks.
When you discovered how to grab it up and they were going to take it and rescued and determined to solve the really, of the engineering and hands of space relations.
Ruimtely insight, because with understanding the world to understand the world to understand the world
If you have an information information that inspired by the physical interaction with objects -- with objects -- together with objects -- with my adviser Pattion and my compassion of Kalanithi -- what if we were to ask me -- what if we were a computer that would be able to ask me -- what if we would have to be a kind of digital finger summit to a plat a plat that indials with the information that individual information that is physical information with objects --
and ordering as we want to do it?
And this question here is that we decided that we decided to go to the building of Siftables.
Sort a collaborate a Siftable computer in the size of a cow-cooky.
They can be moved with the hand, they can feel together they can feel their movement and they contain and they contain a screen and they contain contact.
The core understanding is the physical handles, just as blocks can they get into the blocks can they get into it.
And the follows are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that this aid is a more physical different, sense of their movement and each other, and even of the way that we move them each other, and even of the way we move them to explore and fun interactions of the way we move them to be able to discover them.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that plays and others and others and others and others and others to play and others to play and others to play a slide of the cross-
This interactive portraits of consciousness.
Indians next to each other, they will be put together together to each other.
If they are surround, they can also noticed and what they can become what become nervous and become a little bit of nervous weak and what they can become the nervous, they can also noticed and what they can become surround.
Excuse it and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of these interaction, the use of everyday areas of all of the color as it out, like it was a fluid as it was a fluid list of the color as it was a fluid of the color as it was a fluid content.
In this example three Siftables are three Siftables for and I can use them to go color in a very much much in a very much much much in a very much much in a long time.
And if we have threat the threat what we go back to the back.
There are some of the celebrate opportunities for the education, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the ability and logics that we want to give things things the possibility to see the result immediately.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci of a simple calcular programative.
Here we show a game that a cross-up between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get around a willly literally get around a literacy literally in any Siftable, and send words in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it's very rescued a new series of letters with behind possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I it in the Media Lab, and I slept them and make a video of it.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed almost no instructions of the instructions of the most interesting things that people need.
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to testing it.
That's our youngest ber bididantor tester, right?
And it turns out that he just walked out the Siftables
For him was just blocks.
Here is a interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new carakters in the scene, by just the Siftashion that carakter's table.
Here he leaves the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene scene.
Video: The orange tractor tractor tractor tractor tractor tractor tractor tractor
God d! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Siftables and the nearly seeing to each other, he can response the carakters with each other -- Video: Way!
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it goes on.
Video: The cat fly.
DM: The last example I will show you Is a synthesizer and live music that we developed with a sound music that we developed with a sound producing as the lead, bass and drum.
Eender has four different variations, which you can choose what you want to use which you want to be used to be used to be used to be able to choose what you want to be able to choose what you want to be able to choose what you want to be able to be able to choose what you want to be able to be able to be in which you want to be
These sounds can be injected in the very highly injected so you can determined the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the death of a very own-liliving controll.
They are going to be on a sound and added by the office and by the offices.
Everybody else the general effects like tempo and volume that are allowed to the entire pattern on the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern to a first pattern by a lead.
And now I put the basline.
Video: DM: DM: Now I add a little bit.
Video: And now I copy the filter on the print, so I can affect live the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect live in the effect live the effect live the effect live on the imple of the prins, so I can aaffect the effect live to the effect live the effect.
Video: DM: I can care very accelerating by the office of the Space blows.
Video: DM: DM: Now I copy the filter of the movie for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can repair the pattern as it plays playing.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything that I can improvise and shorter as I want.
In the end of the dimseming of the dimmazing Siftable to left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion goes to make new people to make new human-computer interfaces that are better in the way our brabrains and bodies and bodies and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area that we have a few possibilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the attached to a very new generation to the interacting with digital media that information with digital media that information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to you to all of you all to you.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also writing that much more than that.
My whole life for for a long time I write and I don't think that that will change will ever change that ever going to change it.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career, in my life and career, and I had to be relationship my work with my work with my work with my work on my work with my work on my work on my work and re-career,
It started with a book I wrote that I wrote on a memoire: "Est, Bidden, Bidden, Bidden, that very contrast to my earlier work the whole world about and an international exist.
And the consequence is that people now have to go to me and always told me as though I do in the way to be purpose to be tillustrength.
And that really too.
People come to me and ask to me and ask "Are you not afraid you can never equipment this succes?
Are you not afraid you will keep your entire life but never a book such a book such that people will publish to be warm.
Don't you get there?"
It's restated, you know.
Of course, that would be very remind me that I remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, when I told you that I was writer.
People said, "Don't you have succeed?
Are you to deal for evidence, that you will go to the survive to the one?
You don't know that you have to be your life to this work without that there is ever something that there is ever something out of your bittereal as you get to the mouth of your bittere?"
Something in that streting.
In the short is my answer to that questions on this "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are called "
All right.
But I'm also a lot of other things job, you don't know what everything.
For example, and other engine, and other engineering things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time to where that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it has it to be eight to be a job, for the work for that they have to work for their opinions on Earth are see?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the minesses of the mineshistory, something that doesn't happen to other.
Take my father. He was separtnery, and I can't remind me that there was in the 40 years that he worked on him that he was ever asked somebody to him or he was not afraid to him or he was not afafterward.
And so of course, "Yohn, how are it with your chemby?"
No, so it wasn't talked about.
To fair be: Phincluding engineers through the centuries of the centuries of the reputation of manic, for a piece of manic-depressive alcohosts.
Shavers that have such a reputation.
Not just writer, even other creative people have been in the reputation of humans have been pretty instable.
And look at the grimmy death the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died you, often by their own stiers.
And even though people who don't have a suicide villaimed to be under their gave too too be under their gave too too too be suicide to be under their gaegated places.
In the last interview for his death, Norman Mailer: "With each of my books is a piece of mice."
And that's pretty much to say about your life.
But of these kind of inquarters we don't look at it.
We all heard the first time and have heard it with all the time.
The universe is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity will lead to the suffering and that a artist-existence will lead to misere.
So I want to ask everybody here today to ask everybody here today to live here today?
Findomes that OK?
Because now I think about it, I think it's not a pretty awon't be a pretty awon't do a pretty day.
I think it was reinsull.
And even even even even dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this century, this is also what it is.
We can creative mind a lot better than to live much better to live and live on.
I sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous, to live to that dark dark for that dark in my mind.
Seely the fase where my career is in my career now.
And Go took me a young amper savehicle years.
I can go through the decades of the decades of the decades.
Hishing probably everything that will now be even now now in the outside world as the work that is followed on that extraordinary book.
We're with friends are with friends of the galaxious, and I probably can sells you are probably my biggest success in my biggest success in me.
Yes, what a idea!
If you think about this, you know, it's for you know.
So that's not to be that I don't want to do that.
I love to me with the work that I love to the work that I love.
The question is, "Hu?"
After a long time I have to think of the conclusion that I can just go to write with writing if I have a psychological protection in the process inside the process inside the process involved.
I have to create it writing a safe distance between myself and my conversation between myself and my conversation for the reactions on my future authority audiences.
I was looking for the last year to ways to do that.
I am in the history and I do in the history and floors to see if others to see if others have found or others to help or others to help creative people to help creative process.
My search for my quest Greek and Rombands and Rombands.
And I just want to be a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Rombands and Romband-believed creativity of themselvity of hene.
And they believed that creativity was a godal mind that creativity to the human beings came to the human beings and unknodble reasons.
The Greeks called this calls called this one-mind minds of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he was influist.
The Rominal idea.
As them was such a board creative mind creative mind "geniiious geniie.
The funny is that the Rombs with a genius with a genipiently clear.
In their polar was a genian entities a kind of magical godal entities that were remember in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the huield.
If the artistic was working on the work --
And he gave it to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I first first of all, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work
The artistic was so in protection to be protecism.
If you were brilliant work was brilliant to be all the one.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genius to help you,
Where's what you crossed your work -- just lay that not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genie.
Long time is that it was how in the Western creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There was a very new idea: the individual human mind, the individual human beings is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, in fact, from the goddal world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual lobe.
And for the first time in history there was a genius to say that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and that they had a genius and that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they were not going to be a genius and they were not a genius and not that they were a genius and they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not said that they were not a genius and not
I have to say that I think a big mist.
To let me let one individual individual that he or she is whether she is the essential, the essential, the source of all of the eternal mystery, of all of the measure, creative and the known for a fragic human psyche.
Also, if you ask somebody asks the sun into the sun
Egos are reblowing up to smile, proportions and there are increasingly expectations to prestations to prestations to prestensive to performance
And I think that this drug has made a lot of artists have made a lot of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists that has made a lot of artists of artists the last 500 years.
If that's so on, and I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this?
We can we go back to a parent to an older understanding of the relationship between the human beings and the creative mystery?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years to make rational humanism not uncomfortable in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes to speech.
Probably in the audience people who are remember scientific doubly about the idea that eleras a lot of poeder such with what fact poeder the work of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring the work of artists.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you in there.
And yet me ask it off.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought doesn't have to do that though,
It fasts just as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally calculation that are including in the creative process.
Everybody who have something to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, all of the axy here -- you know, that the creative process isn't always rational process isn't always rational process is not always rational rational process is not always rational process to create rational process is not always rational process to create rational process is not always rational process to create rational process here -- and everybody else.
And that sometimes it is in a paranoral paranorms.
I have the great American poetter Ruth Stone of the American poetteres Ruth Stone of the great American poetteres Ruth Stone of the great American poets.
She's thick in the nine-long life writing.
She told me about her childhood on the plattelevision of Virginia.
Sometimes when she was felt on the work on the work on the work on the field of poems, over the country.
It was so said she said, "Well, as if there was a big wave air from the air
And so my poems, in the country to her devices over the country to her it.
She felt that the ground, and she knew that was started to do and that her at that moment and it was to do to be to do that her at that point, to her life.
She ran home, and she had to get close and she had to do as quickly and then paper and paper and paper.
When it was close by her dog was that her only came up in waves her only chance to write it up.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then they rough, but crossing the house not.
And at such a poem shot the poem by her him, and seek -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poem.
And it was a lot of the story -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they poem the poem of the story -- that they poem.
And then she was looking for the paper and paper and paper the paper and shape, and shape,
Just at that moment she had a ptape to do it.
And with her other hand, so told me them, she plug the poem of the air.
She took it close to his tail and it back into her body, while she wrote it back into her body, while she wrote it.
In that case, the poem came close to what in the poem in the paper -- but then they were reversed sequenced sequenced followed as well.
When I heard that -- what is -- what is accident, my creative process ook!
This is how my creative process ison! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouthrow that every day on the same time on the same time and then flower, and trans and trans and trans and trans on it, and trans and trans on it.
But even in that day-swine days. I have an experience.
You will also know it to know that feeling that there is a sense that there are creative ideas in your released from a source of a source that you can identify.
What is that for bron?
How can we use it without we have that without we'?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed it for a magazine.
We had it over this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life is the shows of his life is the shows of the contemporary artificial artists that are trying to get grip on the unconservative impulses in him up.
With the years of Tom was a little bit more restier.
One day he in Los Angeles on the faster, and changed the process process radical process radical process radical.
As he heard about there, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decision is that the inspiration that does does degrap, ingraph -- smoke --
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to vask it and he wanted to vask it and he wanted to vasthous.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a paperecorder to no page, no taperecorder to the taperecorder to it;
The well-known excited, and then remains that "I remain the melody and then it stays and then it stays me in the century.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it."
He didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat behind the sense of the shape, you can't see that I sat at the point?"
"Do you really think I can write a songle to be able to write now?
If you really want to be able to get later, you have to add even though you have to add if I have time for you.
Not -- not, you know, somebody else.
Go neighborhood's neighborhood." And from that point the process of the process of different.
The work is still the work is even the work on the dark subtoon.
But the heavy that the creative process in him report of the surrounded of the genius when he distant distance of the genius.
The genius genius to close on the skin.
Tom realized that there was no reason that there was no reason to go to the board.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboratic conversation between Tom and the profoundation that not completely of Tom and the property.
That story has changed my way of working.
I have been profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bidden, Biddle --
And at a point I felt in despers.
You know that you know, you don't want to be working and you don't think it's a terrible rainty. The bad book ook ook it. The book book it.
Not just just bad -- not really terrible bad and it's really bad it.
I wanted to do all the project.
And then I reminded me Tom that are geniuse, and I walk and I walk to be a poge.
I wonder I wonder from my manuscrips and direct me to a very much much of the room.
And I said hardoper: "Lister thopers, we know that if this book is not only because of this book is not only by me.
You can see that I have everything in what I have in my own in what I have in me.
I can't give you to it.
If you find that it better than you have to do it.
Snap you now, right? Do you don't thank you.
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notabuland it is going to be seen that is just a difference today that is today to be a different."
Tjaa -- Useen it here on the novely of the
Eeuwen ago, in the North African desert people together to dance with monthlight on monthlight on sacred music.
On and hours, to the hours of the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes happened to be a very extraordinary thing.
One of those dancers then became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen that you ever saw a slightly in a performer.
It was as though the time was was time and the dance of a purch,
He did nothing else than the thousands of night, but now now everything together.
And suddenly he didn't have any human beings a human beings a human beings.
In him, under him of him -- above him hot.
A godddless fluence him.
If something happened to be something like this, they knew people what it was Dan they started clubs and bound, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historic fact, when Moren South South South Spange South South Spanish South South South South South South South South South South South South South South
The spot is echer by the centuries of "Allah" in "Allah" in "Allah" in "Olly."
That hear you have to fight the day at the day's fights and flaments and flaments and flaments
If artists in Spain something impossible or magic, then rop, say, "Allah, oh ost, oh, oh, violence, oo, oh, great, break fold."
Accrazy, see: a slimpse of God.
And recipe rementally what we need.
Lasty is the dance of dance that the dance of dance that the next morning to expect on dinsday to be 11 o'clock in the morning to be a goddal laddly aware
At that moment he is again, a what elder guy with rebad with rebad to such that will never come to such up to such up to such up.
Maybe there will never be somebody God will never touch a while,
What do is it to the rest of his life?
That's difficult.
And that's really difficult to sell a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be not have to be to.
Imagine that you don't have to be the most unusual aspects of your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from you.
Imagine you believe that you have son.
When you are ready with it, they get given to somebody else.
And that's how it was the side.
I indiculous, I think that are thought to be thought to the average
The last months I worked on a book that will be short to be able to be a long time to repeat where much too much to reped.
The remainer of the illuster progress.
And if my mind to the days on the does, I love the same ones don't remember anything that we don't have to remember it.
Do you work.
So if you do this: Watch it is.
If you go to dance you go to dance you'll go and dance it.
If the godal genius is admitted to be decide in your work at a few moment of the wonderful source, then "Oly!"
As that not, dance not, dance but through it.
And then "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that I believe it.
"Oly!"Why, because we can get out of pure human love and property, yet by plug of plues.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen!
You know, I talked about a few of these projects, about some of these projects, over the human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discovering of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point: we were the biology to the digital organization, and now we try to go from those digital code to a new fase in the biology with the design and synthesize of life.
So we've always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think have tried to understand how much biolos have tried to understand in different levels of biolos.
We tried different approach, it back to the back to minimal components.
We are now almost 20 years to digitize the digitize.
When we sequenced the human genome genome of the biology, it went from the analoge world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask for life to regenerate life -- can we create life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organizm, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of like themselves in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at if we can come to a nature smaller.
We can go in the order of hundred of them out of the 500 or who's 500 or who's there.
But if we look at the metabolical maps is that relatively relatively compared to the unsize us.
And this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can explore a piece of living cell that this would be a living cell cell cell cell cell cell of the genes that we can be able to look at all the genes that we can be a living cell cell the genes that we can see.
So we decided that the only route advantage was to synthesize this chromosome to synthesize the components to be able to ask the components to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started a chromosome synthish?"
Staat the chemistry to make these very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, you know, a chromosome "restart?"
A chromosome is the way, but a piece of chemical ints material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of life is accelated on exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code rap rather slow-slowly slow-sizar.
And our last point it would put on this point on an exponential curve.
We have started here over 15 years ago,
There were some of a couple of stages for for the bio-ethical ethical action to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of the more fals.
So we had to make a new method for the collaborate of these little pieces and correct the corports of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of these little pieces and correct the collabord of these little pieces and correct the corn of the wrong.
And this was our first pogonation, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the packages.
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we put a piece of chemistry in the bacteria chemistry in the bacteria genetic code, and virale the genetic code, and virale viral particles are going to make a little bit of the engineering parts.
The viral particles were going to be out of the cells, they came back and they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was unfelt in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they cut too well.
They laughed more than you.
So we think this is a situation where the software building its own hardware is building in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of bigger
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome of the chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of the enti
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassetts in cassetts in the size of viruses, so we could various --
to understand what the actual components of a living cell cell cell
The design is crucial, and if you start start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the
When we first did this genome for the first time was the standard of the first time was the standard precision one mistake a 10,000 basepars.
And finally, we found after resequencing. If we had 30 mists. If we had the original sequence than it was not in the way.
Meances of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can be able to build so that they can design together together to design so that they can be together together to it.
We design here unique parts in the way.
Maybe you have read that we were read water's water's water's going to stop.
Bet, we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, G, and T.
Trios of those cows for ruwy-away -- that there's 20 aminozurs -- that there's an unletter for every aminoxyoxi.
So we can use the genetic code to write, soon, they thought.
And in the way we were signature was just touched
Some were teleurated that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repairs and together.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were five to 7,000 letters were to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, you take a lot of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every dium, we were able to go out of these pieces so that we could sequences them because we could sequences them because we want to create a process that is very robuying -- that will you see stream.
We try to achieve the point of automatiseration.
So this looks like a basketbalfinal finale.
And as we get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow up in E. coli.
That expends the exercise of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
So we went to remember with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolog combination" is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repairs, that bits can add pieces together.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinocococcus radiodurans that three million radiodurans that three million radiation to radiation.
And that you see that in the top panel, set out of the top panel, just set out of each other.
12 ots offered 24 hours later he was going to go back to each other, as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that arrid of these are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can dry drought up to be totally dry.
They can live in a vacuuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space, that can prevent to move a new aquaticks.
NASA has shown that there's a lot of it,
Here's a little microph of the molecule that we've made with these processes that we've made with these processes -- actually actually in the right design mechanisms with the right design.
And it gives them that they add automatically add automatically
This is not an electron-microscope, this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes are taken from six seconds.
This is the auication that we exbrand we explore on the dissease.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by humans, with a clear structure.
The molecule is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point of a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages to pressure.
Well, how do we started, how do we go to the chromosome of the activit?
And it has a virus is clear.
And with a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simple if you give you an away if you give you eukaryots, like wish, you whose the cell and does another in, and that's what you know as it clone.
At the bacterial species is the chromosome of the cell, but we have recently, but we have seen that we have a full transplant of a chromosome of the chromosome of a cell to another another, and it can be an else.
We have a chromosome of a micro-o-purpose of a microbes species.
These are about that far from each other as people and mics.
We added what extra little extra to take for this chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the way.
We have the miracle with enzymes to make all the eggars.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very avanced here -- and you will value the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to soon, but we were trying to develop the process of what further out of the process that further out of it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We found out all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of third chromosome of thousands of own, which they add thousands of own.
People who are going to prepredict as if there are not a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that are restrictions that are really called DNA restrict DNA.
The chromosome that was in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the cell -- the chromosome that we stopped --
It was express express and the other chromosome and the other chromosome as strange material, and why we had the cell the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell of the cell as a cell material, and it recognize the cell as a strange of material, and it was express the new chromosome as strange of material,
He was blue because he was blue the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time disappears of the cell of one species and changed in the new software that we put in the new software that we stopped in the cell software that we stopped in the cell of the cell of the cell of the new software that we stopped in the cell of the new software that in the new software that we in the cell.
All the protein the membranes changed -- when we changed the genetic code was exactly the genetic code in which it was changed.
This is a power as genomical alchemist, but we are in the change of the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change fundamentally change.
All right, I pay that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is previors on 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid that we might be almost a new version of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosion of new species that there are making new species of the Cambrian explosion of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosion of the Cambrian explosion of evolution, which is based in
Why would you this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it needs need.
We're going to go into the squarter of six-and-half billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 46, that will be there are four there.
We have distant with food, with the care of clean water, drugs, fuel for the six-and-a-half billion.
And that's going to be hard to do that for nega.
We use five billion ton collectures, more than 30 billion vessels of oil.
That's 100 miloons of miloons per day.
When we take biological processes in ogent or whatever process than also to replace that is going to be a huge challenge of challenge.
And then of course, all those carbon dioxide of the stunk that carbon the atmosphere.
And by all of our global discoveries we now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had but a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of it.
We are precisely constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques to be able to do a quick must be able to do so called combination genomics.
We now have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day of chromosomes a day
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes or tries to optimes, or tries to optize processes to produce octank, new vaccinine, new vaccinine, we can change with a small team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for life-fatbulity, chemical or fuel production, vaccinine, vaccinement production, etc.
This is a screen image of what real designer is where we work to work on the interest and a new kind of design and a new kind of on the computer and a new kind of on the computer and a new kind of on the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer and a new kind of a new kind of design and a new kind of a new kind of design and a new kind of a new kind of design --
We don't know how it will it look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We fourth of fourth generation.
Realong your foundly ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come in and third generation will come out of sugar, to more high-digniter fuels like octan octan or of different different species of butano.
But the only way we think we think that biology can have big influence without the food price is to reduce and the available is if we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food supply, and why we are the first four, and we think that are doing the first fourth generation of the first generation of the generation generation of months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery. We have discovered all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, at cooking him at calculated temperatures.
It makes me a CO2 with the crosson of molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at if we can take CO2 CO2 which can be easily through pipipes that CO2 to be a regions that CO2 fuel to send this process, to send this process.
So in a short time spend on the basal question that we are able to break out on the basal question: "What is life?"
We actually have true to replace you -- the deeply purchemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this, where you can do this, where you can do?
A major energy source become a major energy source.
But we also work on the use of these tools to think of these tools to think quickly servaccines to think of vaccines to think about it.
This year was the flu -- we always walk just something behind the facts of the facts of the vaccine.
I think that can change by the way of evil combined vaccines to make it the way to make it by by the tools of the shapes of the shapes of the shapes of textomorrow.
And you see how the future can see the future can change the evolution tree, the accelerating evolution tree, the accelerating bacteria, archeeukaryota.
We are still removed from humans to improve people.
Our goal is survive that we make a chance to survive to survive to survive that probably probably you've got to do that probably well. Thank you.
What I want to show you as first to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to brought a new technology that we were in a year ago.
And it's a surroundly environment in you or at the distance with immense amounts of data can work.
We look at many gigabytes of digital images and can stay here on the side of digital and excellent to our equipment and the sorts to our wish and the sorts to our wish and the sorts of our wish and the sorts of our easy gigabies and the sorts of the gigabies and the sorry to our wishs.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information or images or images or images or images.
Most of them are normal camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of Congress, and it's
It all makes nothing because it was only what the prestations would affect to be affected on a square of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture
This is a full book, a full book, an example of the data.
This is the graute house by Dickens. Each cold to be a headadvances.
To prove that it is really text, and not really do a imagination, we can do something something that is really text, we can do something that this is really text.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a way to read an e-book to read an e-book in the way to read an e-book in a book to read.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of an underdeal.
This really gives you really the pleasure and the experience of a real papers or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have done something with the corner of this extension of The Guardian
We made a nerrow resolution of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information --
If you want to see the abilities of this car you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make it for sure that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen.
We hope that this doesn't mean that means and other things that means and other flaw -- not need to be more flawwwo.
Of course are a candle for the hand is a technology for a technology like this, I will spend here to spend here to spend here to spend up here to this field.
These are all the roads in the United States.
and put on top on top of the NASA --
So let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, which is two techniques two techniques together.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promoon, provening to the University of Washington of Washington University at U.Washington University of University of University of Washington and the University of Washington and the University of Washington of the University of Washington
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we can see this, you know, we see that we pultions are going to experience the multiresolution resolution.
The spent shake of the images has this this meant has the beautiful.
The computer vision algorithms have brought these images are building the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadese Rockies -- where they're genome. And in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are elected diassions are space of images, and all these things are space.
I don't know if there is another environments to show you in the environments.
There are still a lot of space.
I want to show one of the Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked in my mind is the communicate power of the environments to be the truth of these techniques in our website.
We had to be able to account with the advoces and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with the Notre Dame with the images from Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images from people in Flickr.
And each of these orange chicken a image that model was a picture of this model turned out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this model that was part of this model turns out to be part of this model that was part of this model turturned out to be part of this model turned out to be part of this model turned out to be part of this orange and each one of these orange --
And so these are all Flickr images, which are copyped in this way of a single of the way.
And we can revigate at simple way.
You know, I never thought I would never work.
It's overwhelming here is so exactly to be in the way.
I believe you can see that these are cameras are cameras well-mirror to mirror cameras a big number of thing, you know, a big number of thing, you have in this environment.
I will try to find some strange images.
There are so much words by faces and things like this.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photos -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also churbed by the program.
If we have the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data -- of the entire collective memory of the entive memory of it looks like anything else -- and heading that everything to each other.
All of these photographs are being together than the parts is a very bigger than the parts.
You have a model that is coming from the entire Earth is going to be on the entire Earth
So see this as a consequences on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual are.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they used to use the prepared and the prepares of the people who used to use it.
Their own photographs are going to be able to be somebody else input.
If somebody would like to climb and their names and their names and their names and their names is going to be able to cross the Notre Dame is that data, and I can use as an access to space, which I can use metap-versum usual versus that metape modale, and created social experience.
And of course, it's be-product of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place of any interesting place on Earth, who not only photographs, satellite images and other applications, but also from the collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I well, well, that what makes your software possible on a day, in the next years, all of the images that are dealed by everybody on the world can copy?
BA: Yes. What this really does is discover
It creates to your wishoms, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the data in the images.
And that is going to be exciting when you think of the wealth of semantic information that are available information that much of these images are available to be available to be available to be available to the wealth of semantic information that is available to the richchchales.
When you look at the web page to imagine a search in the web, and the text on the webpage of information about what the image is going to be able to imagination.
What if now, now, the image of your images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount wealth that comes out of richchality that comes out of the massive network-network-network-network-networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelician.
One of the intense places of travels and of eating eventually is the ability to live between those who are the old living in the wind, who are not forget to feel in the wind, who are still in the wind, the touch of the wind, the profits, the profitting in the wind, the profits, the profit in bitter-biting plans.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still traveling the Milky galaxy, or that the myths of Inextent meaning to meaning meaning or that in the Himalaya boodomestic still workings on the average of Dharma, you remind of the anthropology, the world in which we live in the anthropology, the world in which we lives is not a very absolute to the truth, but is not just one of the truth of the truth,

And it is the most optimistic scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhoods of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of the loss of this is pathy to languages.
And when everybody was born born here was born six-thousand languages.
A language is more than her words' or her gramatic rules.
A language is a front of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that is the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century enemy, a mind, an ecosystem to spiritual an ecosystem to spiritual potential abilities.
And from that six-thousand becomes the day to half of the day is not fluist.

So what I want to do today is to you today on a short journey by the etnos-fire that has to be lost a sketch of what in fact,

The minds can be touple of the Great Water, response to the dance that the soul of the soul of the times, so that during one of the timate moment as the follower is the god.
So why do do do deathis: "You're going to go to the Church and talk about God.

The young acolites are gone with their families when they're three or four or four three or four or four there.

Or it the lives of a mind or a lot of it;
And the interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were crasses to become come crossons to become come crossons to be crazy.
And that made me another people, I was going to be my friends of the Kwagiulth, who believe that that that the forests are the well-ander and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavel and the cannibal mindswall of the world that they were in the north of the world that they were in the Snavy of the Cway's Snavy and the Kuxwhukw and the Kuxelibered of the Kuxwhukw and who who who who who was the Kromme Snavel of the Kuximice, and the Kuxed in the Kuximimimimimimimimimimimimimimimimimimimimice,

It's a picture I april in the North Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive willing to the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating makes fascinating is not just the macological potential to it, but how farmacological potential of two sources.

If you take the plant net, it seems that a blue smoke through your blue dismoke by your consciousness strage by your consciousness strays of the way.
The plant is mixture is mixture of a coffee beyond like a coffee redis.
The plant tryptamines, narrow versus because of brain serotonine, dimethyltryltryltryltryltryptamine, 5-methyltryptamine.
Have you ever seen the Yanomami as they have that snut, that snut, that substance of different species that are also substance of different species that are also substantial methoxyltryptami ptami ptami --
That pooder you nose nose in bloads, as from a mean is educated by the barokay, to be the countries to a sea sea of electricity. This is not reforming the reform of realit; it is under the reality; it is units.
I was trying to convince my professor, Richard Evan Shultanes -- a man who did the psychedelian era of paddo's paddo's in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 193.
I was paying that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect is effect involved in the home, no no one more home, to experience the hallucination of the hallucination because they are not oral in the human dark because they are from their effect in human dark canelectrician: monoxidase.
They can only be oral oral to something that the monoamine of songs on the soil to be impurpose.
The fascinating is that the containing carbolines in the ggang globes are the globe-suppressing the tryptamine to activate the tryptamine of yourself: How can this in a 80,000 planet that have two morphological untaneously species that are that are very shape biochemical variant species of the parts of the parts of parts than the sham that is very larger than the shape of the parts of the parts of the shaptomptomine-ciscism that is of the sonal e?

The Indians say, "The plants talk to us. The plants to us. What does that mean data data data data -- the Cofan, knows 17 variants of ayahuasca, who can identified to identify as one kind of circle would be a kind of money.
If you take their questions to map their taxonomy in the task of plants say: "I thought you were able to know something of plants.
You know that at all, now." I said no.
And it turns out to all the 17 species in a night in a night to different toones in different towards of different towards of seeing in a night to have all the 17 sones.

Now, the problem is that even the problem is that even the those who are seems to be in the history of insultions and colorful seases, but reduced to a footness in history, while the real world, meaning our world, is absolutely by the real world, is meant our world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not reminded to be reminded to be his war, or his technological innovations, but earlier as the era, in the time where we were in the mass or passive destruction to the mass of crops or passionate destruction of biological and cultural diversity. The problem not change.
All cultures always have a dance of new lives.
Technology is not the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians don't stop Sioux to be to be Sioux and treg and treg up as min as that Americans were to be Americans when they stopped and way.
It's not change or technology that is threat. It's driving the integrity of the equivalent to the integrity of the foot of the equival.

And finally, it comes to a choice.
Willen we live in a gray world of unit?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said to her death, to her death, amorf worldview.
We would not only be the human imagination is constrained to a mely, modal thinking, but also we would have to wake and forget that there are other options also have other options that there are also other options of exist.
We can feel in the idea that our kind of pas we can just think about [15,000] years,
The Neolitical Revolution, who gave our agriculture that we gave to the cult of the shaman when the potry of the shaman by the proza by the proza specialization of the priess, and we found a concluded by specialization of the priess.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
This surface that surface history that we have all the answers to all the answers that will have all the questions that will come to our path.
If the intelligence cultures of the world to people the meaning of humans are asked to the meaning of the people are asked voices.
And it's in that song that we will discover the ability to be discover to be what we be: a people, which is a people, which is all in the work to be able to get all the gars to be blood.
This photograph I have taken on the northern point of Baffin Island when I went to Inextended to be on the Inextended to be yourself.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadean government is not always been friendly for the Inexcited. In the 195, to follow our south of the 1950s, to focus in setttings.
The opa of Olayed to go.

Now you have to understand that the Inuit not afafraid for the colle; they use of the colle; they use it.
The gli-ice ice ice ice ice ice boards originally made of fish in cribs.
Olayutilian was not afafraid for the poolnaight or the storm that wind was that wind.
He went out to outside, his breezing skin, of sea skin, and he started to freeze, and then it was starting to woman, he started to woman, he shaped it as a limmet.
He brought a low-taking layer on the side of the sides of the wall.
And when it was solid, he was to slaught a dog of them.
He was the dog and improvised a harnaive a hearnas.
And then the ribban he made a bable.
He was looking at a dog in the neighborhood, and disappeared in the ice flake, including pooppeas.

In april 1999, the Canadean government the Inuit the Inuit the Inuit the Inuit in the entire consider than California and Texas sams and Texas soon as it is our new home.
It's independent. They remember, all the solid straight and the soon.
It's a bluffing example of how a native environment to her people can be able to by.
And finally, I think it's clearly to that it's clearly at least for who is required to these homomics of the world is really, that they actually don't really far away.
They are someonmands at home.
They are going to be for twices of human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, will be the dreams, just like the uncertainly part of a unconnected geography of hope.
And what we finally do at National Geographic, is never going to be reachievement from the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic -- we think that a point of point that is not convinced that stories can change the world, that we probably the best stories that we probably the best storytellers in the world is 35 million times a months a month-share in 156 million times a month-shine publics and our magazining publicly public.
We make a felt to travel, to the eat the eat, with our audience, to the public, to such a very special places, where the toixic cultural public and that hopefully to be more than the anthropology that will be anthropology is going to be able to live in a diversity, that this world in a way to live in a multic world to be in a multic world to be in a multic world and pluralististic world in a multipluralistic world and pluralistic world and pluralististic world to be to be to be to be to be in a way to be able to be in a lot of the way to be in a lot of

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about a few questions that I have an intended to be a book in a book for change.
Maybe you see paralls with information of information from other sources.
I also try to explain some of the regular that you might have mind.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To become exactly to be exactly the official dogma, industrialized society.
And that official dogma, as a follow: Om the wales of our neighbors on the highest level, we need to give them so much as possible individual freedom of the possible individual freedom of the way to be as much as possible to get them as much as possible to be as possible to get
Freedom is a big good, an essential part of the human beings of human beings.
And the freedom of freedom is to acting to acting a higher well-well-well-well-to-well-to-reaching several without insides.
The ultimate freedom we find in choiceality.
More choices loves in that people have more freedom to have more freedom to have more freedom to be freedom in that people have freedom in that people have more freedom to have more freedom to have more freedom to have more freedom to have more freed.
And more freedom means automatically means more well.
This is so deep getting into our society that nobody would take on it to be doubt.
And in our lives is this dogma, you know, in the way.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choices.
This is my supermarket. A middle of the high.
Even about dresss.
And at the time that 175 changes are threats of the supermarket, in my supermarkets different out of extra-virgin oil and twalf different balalance balance balance.
And that you can make a task of the task of the case between 175 species for you, that you know, the case in the side of you.
So that's the connected of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can put your stereoset up your stereoset of it, cassettespeler, radio, verster.
At one electronicawinkle you can choose from this number.
You can be six-and-half million different systems, with parts of these store.
Get me -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young ago you could ask all sorts of telephonors, but only at Ma Bell.
You were on the tack. You bought it.
That was the way that it had never been the advantage that it never go.
And that time is for.
Training today there are a lot of different devices.
And in cell phones is the diversity is immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-player, neusiod and cryer, and cry: A brandoming brandom.
And if you don't have this model this model in the wincell in the wincle that happens in the wince-seen that will happen in the wince?
The sequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
N.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do too much too too much too too much to too much too much to be too too too much to buy that doesn't do too too much to be a mobil.
And in aspects of life that are more importantly, more important than the attackages, this explosive explosive to a fact.
Gealth care, -- it's in the United States is not that you go to the doctors that you go to the doctors and that you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do A do, or we can do, or we can do, or we can do, or we can do, or we can do, or we can do, or we can do, or we can do, or we can do, "We can do to do, or we can do, or we can do, "We can do do But,
A has this front and after sharing.
Bs have this front and down. What do you want to do?"
And you go, "Dokter, what do you find in the way?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front and Bi, and Bi, and nadelivered this front and nadelivers.
What do you want to do?"
And you go, "Does if you was doing?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you to you."
And we call that "own inbrings of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision is to decipatic medicine of things -- the doctor, to a life's deat, somebody who are frequired to a decisions -- the patient. For on the patient. For on recipatient mes. For republic member.
Good considered that feature up, because the goal group, you and I cannot buy to buy them.
Why do advertising, if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we think we are going to be able to ask our doctor to ask that other maintains to ask that other mains.
Our identity, yet an aspect of us are now over, now overovernight, now as you can see on choices, like you can see on this slide.
Our identitity is that our identity,
We find ourselves from -- so often we just want to do.
Everybody morning, you have to think about what you want to be thinking what to person you want to be thinking about what to person you want to be thinking about what to person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that freedom that freedom of everybody out of the way that you can squickly as possible to children as possible, and then as possible to children
The only true choice was with who, not when and what you do was going to do --
Now free everything to the operate for the opportunity.
I lesson to extract at intelligent students, which I have double work than early.
They are not dommer or in the early way in early time,
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Will I say, "Don't smark?
Or will I wait? Is I first children, or do I first children, or a care?"
These are all the way to ask for the
They go through to them through the answer, even if this means that they don't get their househomework and then no good couple of fre.
And they have the same life. They're important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave all that technology is that technology is able to work every minute of every day where in the world -- except in the Randolph Ho.
There's one place that I love the secret that I love meant where Wify does.
I don't think that because I don't want to keep that place for myself.
But good, who are choice, who are eattackages in that we are incredibly ask and then ask to the question, or not.
We can look at a football of our son, with our son, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry.
And even if they're all from the way that they all come from that all of the things that are all sorts of questions, "Am I ask this phone, "Am I responsing?
Is I response? As I written this letter write?"
And even if the answer is "now, we experience the football of our son in a very different way.
Where we also look at the big, the big, materialistic things, living is a question, life is a kwest issues.
And this is how the world used to look like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a knew on the issues.
And so the world looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what is good about what is good about what is going on.
And that huge choices has two effects, two effects, two effects on the human beings.
A very contradict is that the earlier paralyzed than frequire than frequired than frequired to be in the conversation is that it before.
And with so many choices are people like the hard to make the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example, a research to investments in volunteas.
A colleague, a colleague, and I got access data of Vanguard, a great policy-major policy-flowing components of 2,000 employees about 2,000 fight.
They found that for every 10 policies that for every 10 policies that the work-took two percent of the parage.
As a way that we did did 10 percent less employed, and less employees than five than five than five than five squire --
Because it is at fifth of five is so difficult that people the choice that people look at the next day, and that people look at the next day, and that that up, and that up, and that on it, and that go, and that on it, and so on.
And of course, from the point.
That doesn't mean that means not only that people after their pensionate to eat because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money because they have been seeing enough money was so hard to have the work-crazy for them to have a lot of the choice for it.
They were going to be able to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose for.
The work-to-double to double their own contribution to double.
So too much choices can be working on a light of choices.
And I think the world looks like that.
If it goes to the century, you want to be very very much to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be remember with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
And that's the first effect. The second thing is that we'd be as we dish the lamining of our disscreaming and choods, ultimately less pearing than the case, if we had less options of the result than the case, if we had less options if we had less options as we had less options to be if we had the case.
There are multiple reasons for to do it.
One of the choice, for example, for example, from tasy tasy that the choice was not perfect.
You ask you in this case, for that a different choice for that would have been better.
This droom alternative alternative to that you get spids of your choice.
And it soil is going to be able to the follodo, even if it was a good choice that you made it in a good choice.
And the more options are there, desasion, it's to have the more spids of uneth, which element of the getting options.
A second reason has to do with substitutional cost.
Dan Gilbert gave all of how often we depend the value of things that we depend of things that we are going to be able to equivalent them.
If you think that if you can inthink of many alternatives you all see the attractives of all alternatives that you describe the attracy.
That makes you that less peaces with the alternative that you have chosen the alternative that you have chose.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is a slide in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second wound.
They are on a beautiful strand. Stralend again.
Beter can not? "Don't be the "Don't be carry," "It's audience.
Everybody in my neighborhoods in Manhattan is the city ouple of the city of it.
I could flow my car for the door, for the door,
And he is two weeks to the idea that he was missing every day that he was mislesson on on a great parking place.
substitutioncost of the enough of the engineering cost of our choice, even if we make a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are going to be attracting in the more alternatives are there.
And those presenting to us as substitutional cost.
Another example.
This is the image stories to a number of points.
Life in the right here, and for example, and you don't have to consider things that you have to consider things that you have to consider things that you have to overcome
Another point is that you look at any choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice other choice is that you get out of the choice is that you can decide with every choice other choice other choice is you to get out of the cho
And all that other has been so attract option to the sequences that the requently touchically.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in my quest to look at a new breezing for a new breezing of the new breed.
I turned out to almost always playing.
And it was the pair of that they bought to be bought and that bought it doesn't have the past, the past, it doesn't have incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the breezing long enough and often enough and often enough wasted enough and often enough and often enough it right.
After years I went to the store for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to be a stupid my me."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart fit, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Welt you or a rhyth? Whilt you were a riting?
Welt a breek with closer effect?
Wilt you something exploites, or fline, or flink of pippipes, and so he went through it.
I was talking about it was sprapid of the time I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only one."
He had no idea which was not an hour for a long hour for an hour for all the possible bble breed.
In fact, I love the store of winke, I let the store ended breezing breezing breezing breezing breet.
I was better in the better, I could do it better.
But I don't felt better.
Why? To this to myself, I wrote this on myself, I wrote a book of it.
The reason I don't feel better, and I was to expect that I started to expect that I started to expect from the fairly played to be able to expect a good job.
I started without any expectation, because I was just one kind of spirit, and one kind of spirit --
And when it turned out that there was different wars, and one of the perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I read my breezing with my own expected to my expect me teleur.
The more possibilities people have to have more expected to be more expectations of the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means that people are less beyond with results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about.
In the really goes to be about that.
Everything was better when everything was bading.
Because when everything was bad was bad to people still have surprising experiences have been surprising experience.
In our modern society can we as well as well as a well perfection perfection perfection, but the best thing that we can ever achieve is that something that we could expect.
Never we become surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, tower, and high.
The secret of happiness -- this is to you all come to you all come to be -- the secret is not too much much to expect too much much to be too much much as well.
I want to be here -- a car biographic element, I was married with a woman who is really fantastic.
I didn't have me with her under with less tears.
But with less enough to take a good side.
And finally, when you have a bad sat at the spirit is a bad sat as there is only one kind of predicting, you can ask you to ask why you are until to ask you that you are unteaching.
The answer is that case.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds, and you buy to fall, and you buy to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer to that is just so simple -- that's you've got you.
You could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different breezing in the way to failure.
So if people decided to decide even if the results of those decisions are good about their choice.
And they take itself.
In the western society celevates the left depression under the younger generations.
A factor -- not the enge, but it's a significant factor factor in this explosive incredible and self-suicide experience is that people have to be very much more teleuring experience of their expectances.
And if they try to explain the explaining for itself, they give themselves the descend.
So the nettoresulat is that we have objective to for, but our bads, and our bads.
As a collaborate together.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody to where is going to be reversy.
But that's not.
It doesn't suffered to be able to choose that can be better than not cannot be able to choose that more choice is even even more choice is even better.
There's a magic grounds. Wale, I don't know.
But I know that we are for for a long time to the point that choices are being choices us what are behaving us well as well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best one.
The choices are industrialized countries come out of material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard before, where the problem isn't so much choice, but right now.
So the paradox that I talked about here for the moderne, so that I talked about that moderne, which is what we have to be able to do it.
And that's frustrers, and it's all the way to this is that extend to installying, you would told that expensive and sun. Sunt your money.
I say the same about this pire, intricated choices -- they don't help now, they focus not, they focus to, they focus to.
They make us less value.
If you have a part of what people in our society to make all those choices to be survived to be transmission, the life would be reversing to be able to go forward to it.
And our lives on the way to go forward.
That's what economists a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reverse of well-of-freedom -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the choices that we have with us.
Finally, you know, if you read this image story -- you like this sculpture that fish fish this slide fish -- "Ah, what knows that fish fish fish this fish --
Nothing is possible in a fish coming in a fish coming in a fish."
A scrale imagination, a shrale imagination, a short global imagination.
But the longer I took about it, I understand that this fish I understood that this fish is the same smart.
Because in fact, in fact, if you have the fish crow: If you get the fish to create potential to create opportunities to create potential to create potential to create potential to create potential to create potential to create opportunities to create potential to create potential to create opport
If you get the fish crossing to create potential to create potential to be less task your less task to create potential to create potential to create potential to create potential to create potential to create potential to create potential to create potential to create potential to cre
It leads to more disconnected and less ractions.
Everybody has a fish to need to be needed to have a fish.
This is free sure -- possible even for the fish, but certainly for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the determination of a figures to be asking questions to misery, distributed, unhead.
Thank you for your attention.
