Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the polar cap, which was the polar cap, who had about the size of the vaction of the United Statand 40 percent of the United States, 40 percent was crows.
But this is actually the nst of this particular problem because it doesn't show the devices of the ice of ice of the ice.
The ice skap on the North Pole, in a certain sense, is the closing heart of our global climate system.
It's in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I showed is a accelerate version of what happens is happened in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is touched in the rood.
As you can see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the annual ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in summer.
The so-called permanent, five years or older, is almost like flowing blood, which is from the body is slight here.
In 25 years is the way this is going to this go.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icelerate Icels and there is a very large amount of woman is frozen carbon is a very large amount of woman is being emerged in methane.
Some of the total amount of display in the atmosphere, that could be defined to the amount that could be double if we described the case that can describe the amount of the debiting point.
In some in-depth in Alaska sign of methane in the water.
Again, Professor Katey Walter of the University of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another one deep to another one deep here.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is OK. The question is going to be that will be that we will be that are.
A reason for that, is that this huge is that this huge is called Greenland from the north north.
This is a melectwo-fre.
The water volume is the waterm larger than equal equal
This is the Kanger-raf-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea squeezes because the agricultural is the place where it is the place where it comes in the sea around,
These strains are flu.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, invents the largest ice mass on Earth.
Again, the last month month scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance balance balance --
More specific is the ice-South Pole, very quickly melt, with some of the South Poild of the South Poilands.
The whole continent to six meters sea square meters sea single sea --
In the Himalaya, the two of them -- there are now new mass and now are new mass and a few years ago, who were a few years ago.
40 percent of the global population is half of his dress water of the water of melers.
In the Anth, is this gaps the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more flow today.
But when they disappears, the drinkwater.
In California was a 40 percent in California 40 percent in the Sierra.
And it comes in the water reservoices in the water reservoice.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of the predictions
This global dreamed dreamed to a dramatic stying,
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen any speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years, in the previous 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeds.
If you look at the guys from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 24 hours every 24 hours.
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, Look at the east area of the Stille area of the Stille of America, and each side, and each side, and each of each one of the Indian subcontinent to each one of the ocean.
The only big case, the only big case, the one of the Earth, nearly deforest, which is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is the most biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest exists with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coalax.
But we see a circle.
These are the coal-carbon which the bull-coal-in-year-old alternatives were removed in the last years, and where green alternatives were readed.
There's a political fight in the country.
The coal carbon and oil industire industire last year, 250 million dollars to promote coal coal coal coal coal coal coal in order to promote it.
And that image did to me to something like a thing to think about something like this.
And the Christmas became home in Tennessee, about four billion liter cool, about four billion gallallons of making model.
You probably seen the news of the news of news in the news of news
This is the one after one after one after one of the largest way.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising coast was the coat the least shed Cerst-was this:
Video: ""Frosty the coal carbboman is a stay behind up.
He's affected to America, and he causes in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coal carbboman is scree with the day day
He's paid and cute cute and employees their job."
Here is a big particular particular particular in West Virginia food from day.
The largest mine mine most worker of the country is the big boss of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwship -- "Let me be clear Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know where they talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on too.
This is a piece of one of them from a one.
Video "Bue COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat for our business for our business.
That's why the reason the reason is the most important goal is to give a giant connect to the light to the light and the left of the light and the left of the light carbs.
Fit is, stead, it's not smark.
We find that the clean is -- and it still seems at the back.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me talk about our thing.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shore carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon centrale.
Fantastic! The machines make a very little bit of lai.
But that's the sound of shone carbon technology.
Despite the fact that the fact that the most important causes of the most important causes of the most important causes of the Earth is the scale of global warming technology that you see here.
Look at the shoot carbon technology of today.
Al Gore: Eintually, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternational security.
Video: Stem: StemAmerica wrong in crisis, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red red to all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels, as dirty collipse and imported oil, as vuilian oil.
But now there's a purpose new solution to get out of this.
And far America of 100 percent scaled shan electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get to get the work to get to work to get a security of safer and the warming of the Earth is making the Earth is a fr.
And eventually a solution that are enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Repower America.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: I: Itâ€™s re-in-power.
One of the speed ways to make a end of the fast-de-dependence of old fuels that our planet to help our planet to help see.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: New investments to create good paid jobs to create jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African old African old African old African old Africans, "If you want to be all of it.
If you want to go far far together."
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called a update about how that machine works.
So here I am a biggest those who are not waren't waren't the largest scientific experiment ever scientific experiment has ever underneath in the ground, 27 kilometers in the ground.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billions of second after the universe started to be a billions of the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, set --
This is the machine Geneval Genevation.
We took photos of that mini-Bangs in detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter in diameter.
Spectation picture of ATLAS in ATLAS in the scale.
In 10 septeer -- we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that cared a party in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle straight that was all around the LHC was going to go around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC, which was radied in the detector floor.
In other words, when we knew that picture on 10 September the machine was working on the machine is a huge over.
I don't know whether this is the biggest across the biggest of Google and saw that the Internet page out of the Internet page out of the Internet page of this is so far from the Internet page in the beig.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientistic impact of a scientistic impact as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was doing with these golden drams.
And those behaviors ago, 13 thousand ampeers when the machine working at full power.
The engineers will say, "Not true will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superago,
So on min 271 degrees -- colder than the space between the stars, that can behaviors that flowing flowing the blowing of the stars, that flowing the space between the stars, that can behavior.
In one of the connective between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive constructive error.
And it was a wire thing warmer, and it was intended to that 13 thousand ample of them --
This was the result.
This is still insultions if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons -- and they were about 30 inches were moving to move touched about 30 inches --
We had about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We have all repair of them when they all have repulling them at the time.
Now they are back to row.
Eind mands will be intact.
We will go to the back and we expect it to expect it to expect the way to go out and expect what the building of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe are going to be further to the universe --
Now, of course, those unfortunate the debate re-research of scientific research research for the value.
I think the fact that it's really hard to be so difficult that we go further than the LHC.
I showed the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to define the decade of the values of the values of the values of his learner, his learner, his learling was Michael Faraal, this is a dangerous for the progress, and they have no new science of science of science of science of science of science of science in the natural world -- and that there are no new global god."
Thanks.
I would like to start to ask you back to your kids back to your children at your childhood time playing with blocks.
When you discovered how to grab it to go up and conscious, and conscious, you were actually learning solving the connection with the deal with and hands of space relationship from space relationship to the end-up and hands of space relationships.
Ruimtely insight, is a strong connect of the world to us.
If a information is inspired by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- with objects -- together by the name of Pattion and my fashion Jee-center-like -- I started to ask to ask -- what if we could use a computer to ask -- what if we would use a computer to a kind of digital finger at a kind of digital finger Cor, which we can freshare with the information of a plate information with the information of information that can free information with audience in the needs of information
and ordering order?
And this question was so far, that we decided to search a response of Sifta less.
Sort society is a Siftable computer is a cow-size computer size a cow-cow-cow-cottil.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel each other, they can move each other, and they contain and they contain and wireless a screen and wireless the contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traffic, just like blocks can be moved by grabbed to grab it.
And the other thing dies are Sifta less-example of a new ecosystem for manipulation of digital information.
And this is that this aid is a more physical ship, have a more physical ship, and even from each other, and even of the way we move them from each other, there are different new and fun interactions of the way we move them to discover and fun interactions of the way that we move them from each other.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftis instonishing a video to tell a video that is playing by the opportunity and other other people, plays plays and others plays plays --
These interactive portraits of conscious.
Indians next to each other, they will be put together together to each other.
And if they get surround, they can also do this and can be a little bit and become a little bit of nervous careful.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all building, as it was a fluid of color as it was a fluid of color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of color as it was a fluid of the interaction of this interact,
In this example, three Siftles lessols for and I can use them to good, and I can use them to good, where they become a living,
And if we have the float, we went back to the back of the back.
There are some of the opportunities for education, essentially game game with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people people people to give the result of the immediately, and the result of the result of immediately,
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci by a simple,
Here we show a game is a game is a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single set around a lot of tape of every Sifta and case in a dictionary words are being controlled in a dictionary.
After 30 seconds it's very really, very really, a new series of letters with a new series of letters with a very high left opportunities.
Thank you.
These are a few kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I bear them out and make a video of them and make a video of it.
They were really away from them.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people don't need instructions.
Everything you need to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people test the test thing.
That's our youngest ber bree-botest breedom.
And it turns out that he was just the Siftles.
For him was just blocks.
Here is a interactive paintingly painted here.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning from language.
This is Felix that demo.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that character of the table.
Here he shows the sun emergency of the sun coming out.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene area.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good goa! Yeah! Yeah!
By the shifting of Siftles and the needle to each other, he can respond to each other, and the nexta -- Video: World W: World Wo!
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to the paths.
Video: The cat fly;
DM: The last example I will show you Is a synthesizer and live music and live music today that we developed a sound produces a sound producing as the lead, bass and pressm.
And one of the other variations, where you can choose what you can choose what you want to use
These sounds can be injected in the age of injected so that you can actually determine the pattern itself to determins.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the task of a livable effects of a livable effects of available effects like reverb and filter.
They are become a sound to a sound and accell by the side.
And then the general effects like tempo and volume that are being added on the whole pattern of pattern in the whole pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the whole pattern of the pattern of the whole pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the pattern effects like tempo and volume
Let's see a look at it.
Video: Did we start a living in two Sifta in two Sifta less-first pattern by a lead.
Now, I put the basline.
Video: Do I feel like to do a bit slagwork
Video: And now I coping the filter of the filter of the presses, so I can actually affect live the effect live in the effect of the press,
Video: Design, I can get it very accelerate by the offices of the tempo blocky.
Video: Did I copy the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: Do I can reach the pattern as the playing.
So I don't have to do everything to plans, but I can improvise the whole longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make a very longer and make a very shorter and make a long long we, and I can do not impro
And finally the dimseming the dimses of the volume Siftable to the left Siftile to the left Siftile to the left Siftile to the dimes.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is to make new people, my passion to make new people, which are dested better in the way our brains and body working on the way our brains and body working and body working and body working on the way our brains and body working on the way our brain and bodies work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this designer to show you one new element in this design area that we develop in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the attack-profoundation to a whole new generation for the interacting with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from my ground.
I look at it to you all to you all the time.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life for a long time I write writing and I don't think that that ever change.
And yet is recently happened in my life and career, and career, I had to see my relationship with my work to see my work to see my work on the work of relationship to my work on the work of a lot of the work.
And it started with a book I writing un-defense -- a memoire: "Et, B, Beminnergency to my earlier work on the whole world went to my first work, the whole world and an international exist.
The consequence is that people have to go and always told, and always told, as if I do do a little bit everywhere.
And I think that -- gets do!
People come to me and questions, "Do you can't have this success, "Don't you might never be equar?
Don't you think your whole life will be writing your whole life but never a book will be, a book such a book such that people will walk warm to write your whole life will write for the people to write for you will write to write your whole life will never write to write your whole life will write a book that people will write
Don't you get to far there?"
And I took you are.
Of course, that would be very very of, I remember that I was a teenager, I was a teenager, when I was a teenager, I was going to become a teenager.
People said, "Do you don't get success that you will never get succes?
Do you don't know afraid to deal with it, you will go to the convers?
Don't you get your life to this work is going to do this work without any of the work, and that you will have ever die, and that you will die, and you will have to your bag with your bag with your bags of bitter-a-bitter axing your bitter-bitter-bitter axism is that you have ever done to your bag with your b
Something in that stretation.
In the short comes to the questions on that questions on this is "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are called all those things that are called the things that are called
Also, all of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things that you don't know what everything.
For example, and other engineer, and other ends.
But what does is writing myself to write myself the last time that comes from.
Is it rationel?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be a focus to work for the work for the work for the work for the worth of the worth of the work for the work for the work for the work for which they are at their mention,
What is so particular to creative processes that we make sure the effects of the mind-mind-mindness, something that happens to other, something that happens to other.
Take my father. He was a separate engineer, and I can't remember that there in the 40 years, he worked at the 40 years, he was asked somebody has ever asked to him that was not afraid to him that was not afraid to him that was not afraid to him that he was not
And so of course, "John, how are it with your chemist?"
No, I don't want to talk about it.
To be fair to be, separate engineers have been seeing through the centuries of the centuries for a lot of manic-depressive alcoholists to be copy to be a male coholists to be fair --
Scheat, who have a reputation.
Not just writer, also other creative people have become other creative people have became quite quite instable.
And just look at the grimp death the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
Many felt you, often seeing own stiered by own too.
And even those who don't even are a suicide of their suicide to be under their gaviling too be considered to be under their suicide too suicide to be under their suicide to be under their gave too suicide to be under their gave town.
In the last interview for his death said "My Mo-each of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of mitself dis."
And that's quite a little to say about your life-work.
But of these kind of spoke of these kind of spoke of the kind of spoke of these kinds of spoke of these kinds of spoke of these kinds of spoke of these kinds of spoke of these kinds of spoke of spoke of these kind of spoke of spoke of the kind of spoke
We all have heard it all before, and have it been accepted.
The hemission is that creativity is that creativity is unlocked to suffering and that a artist-eventually to eventually lead to miserable.
And so I want to ask everybody here today to ask everybody here today?
Do you see that OK?
Because I think I think about it, I think it's not a very good thought, I don't think it's a very fast thought.
I think the reader the reader of the reader
And also even even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century is a too.
We can create much better than a lot better than to live much better to live in the way to live
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, particular to that dark to that dark to.
In fact, the fase in which my careers is in my careers now.
Go just took me me a young, amper vehicles.
I might be able to go through decade four decade decade.
Hism probably everything I will be more more publicly by the outside world as the work that is the work that followed on that extraordinary book.
We are here with friends under the other, so I can be able to do it very highest success is my greatest success is behind me.
Just what a little idea!
And if you think of the morning is to you know the morning to the morning to negor, you know, at the hour.
So I don't want to do that I don't want to do that.
I love to the work I love working to the work I like to work I love the work I love the work I love the work I love the work I love the work I love the work I love the work I love the work I love like this.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I have to think of the conclusion that I can just go to write with write as I can just a psychological protection in the process of building.
I need to create the write a security of security between mitself and my connection to the reactions of reactions to my future published future published audience in my future publics.
I had been looking for the last year, I was looking for ways to do that.
I am in history and I do do dos and have me in other civilizations to see or others to see whether others to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search too has brought me to the old Greek and Romeins.
Let me have a long time and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greek and Rombitched people not that creativity was from honest,
And they believed that creativity was a god-follow-a-accelerable place, unknown place, to humans and unknown fail, to humans and unknown for fail,
The Greeks called this calls of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And Socrate that he was a demon who was a demon that he was demon the words of influist.
The Romb had a species of the same idea.
And in them was a genius such a genius is a genious genius
The funny is that the Romb with a genius with a genius to be a very piently piled person
In their policy was a genius a genius entity, a genius entitt in the walls of the ateler of the artist.
And a little bit like Dobby the house --
And if the artistic was working on the genius assistance.
And he gave it to work on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the earlier, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work work.
The artistic was so in protection to protect for example,
If you was brilliant work was brilliant to be all the hir.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genius to help
Well your work was too, you know, I was not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather indepengue genia.
Last time is that we had been considered to the West creativity was considered to the West creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There is a whole new idea: the individual human idea: the individual human universe and is above all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, animated from the god-frator from the god-size.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual frequency from the individual frequency from the individual forward.
And for the first time in history was there was a genius in history was a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius
I have to say I should say that I think a big mistake.
To make one person, one answer individual to make a person, the essentially, the source of the century of the century of everything that goddlab, creative and the known present to responsibility to a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in swallowed to swallow somebody to ask the sun in the sun.
Egos are reduced to gigantic proporations and there are incredible expectations to performanced to performanced to performance performance to performance to performance perspective of performance to performance perspective of performance to performanced to be reduced to performance to be higan-connections to be reflected to a small proportion,
And I think this pressed the last 500 years, a lot of artists have made a lot of artists of artists
And if that's so on, and I think is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we go back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human and creative mysteri?
Maybe not.
We can just make 500 years, we can rational rational home, in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes speech.
Probably in the audience people who are reduced scientific people who have reflected about the idea that elfocus with some of fact that elfar-like the work of artists of artists to inspiring high-like the work of artists.
And I don't seem to me that I will get you to get to you,
And I asked it to me.
Why does not?
Why would we don't have that thought of the mind?
And it just as much as much as well, as all the other explanations of totally calculated in the creative process.
And everybody who have to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, all the attacks, you know, the creative process doesn't always become rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to create rational process --
And that sometimes it feeling a paranormally,
I have the great American closer American closer Ruth Stone is dissed.
She is thick in the nine-on-scree they pull in the ninevant
She told me about her youth on the plattempt of Virginia.
Some times if she was the field of the work, she was a poem of attacks, about the country.
And it was so says, as though there was a big wave air came air from it.
And so that is close golfed over the country to her --
She felt that the ground, and she was saying to shake her at that moment but one thing to do is to do one thing to her life: render for her life's living in her life.
She ran home, back to home back to the close and then they had to do it as quickly and paper and paper to pick up and paper than so quickly paper than so quickly to get to paper than so quickly to paper and paper than so quickly to get to the paper than so quickly possible.
When it was close by her hand her hand her hand her only was her only chance to write it to write it on the way to write it was only chance to write it was her only to write it was a close to write it was a close to write it was a close opportunity to writing the close to write it was a close to write and w
Sometimes she was not quickly enough.
Then and roughly it reaches it doesn't reach the house.
And at such a lot of shes the poem by her him, looking for the fields, looking for a lot of -- in her words -- to another denser animal other denser -- to another poet -- to another poet me have to another poet -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in
And I also had a lot of the story -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the close to almost deal with the close to mine the close to mine.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper the paper and paper the close by her home.
Just at that time she had a potle-tape to packaged to packs.
And with her other hand, so told me them, they told me them, plug it from the air.
She paid the close to his tail and it back in her body -- and it back in her body as she wwrote the back in her body --
In that case, the close to the close to my paper in the paper and then very close to paper in the entirely of the followed order.
And when I heard that -- I thought -- what is accidently, my creative process creative process of creative process of the creative process of --
And so my creative process! I'm not a mem! I'm not a mem!
I'm a mouth, who is a muile, who has been on the same time and trans with blood, swood and trans through it, and trans through it.
But even in that daily swood, I had such a experience.
You will also know the same thing that is that there is a sense that there is creative ideas in your relen from a source that you can identify impossible to identify impossible to identify the way you can identify from a source of the things that you can identify the same thing you can identify to do you can identify the same thing.
What is that then to bround?
How can we use it without a lot of the way we become a who's health?
And in a way that is good for us to do a way that is?
The best contemporain example, I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interview him for a magazine.
We had this stuff.
Tom is actually a lot of his life is a lot of his life has been shown in the contemporary artistic artists that all power, and get to get the impulses in the unconnection in him of the impulses in him of the impulating in him of the impulse of the connection in him of the contemporary of his life is actually actually to get to
And the 190s, Tom a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the 190s.
And one day he save in Los Angeles on the fast weight and changed the process of radical radical.
And while he heard a clip of a melodie.
The decision, as inspiration that does does a faker is degrapher, cwellend.
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to fashion the fashion.
But that was not going to do it.
He had no pap, he didn't have a pap, no tand, no tape at the time.
The well-known excitement is a regular and then the melodid, and then it stays and then stay behind me etersequence.
I'm not good enough, I can't be too."
He didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news and did something news now.
And he looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, can you see that I sat the well?"
"Do you really think I can write a songle to write a song?
And if you really want this song to get it later to you have to have time for you.
And it doesn't go to anybody else a little fall.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Coh." And from that time the time the process of the process of the process of a lot of different.
The work is the same thing to do is the known dge dark subtoon.
But the heavy exciting the creative process in him report of the genius of the genius of the genius.
The genius is to close to the skin, and the living only one.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go to get to go to the equal to go to it.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre society of a conversation between Tom and the propertile aspect that not completely of Tom itself,
And that story has changed my way of working changed.
I have been profit from it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bidden, Beminning.
And at a point moment I felt in despers.
You know that you know, you don't want to work and you don't want to do a terrible disasting a terrible disappear.
Not just just bad a really bad thing.
I wanted to do the whole project to all the project all project.
And then I remember Tom that are genius to be genius to way. And I also decided to way.
I was going to go from my manuscrip, and direction to a very much of the room.
And I said, "Lister then, "Lister thing, we know that if this book is not just brilliant by me.
You can see that I have to do everything I have in the way I have in it.
I can't give me a lot of it.
If you find that it better than you have to get your thing.
Do you know that you don't do that, you'll do that, youammer thank
I just write because that's one time my work.
Oh, and in the notils are being remember, and it is just a different way to be a chance of change."
Tja--- Uentirely it to be taken up here.
Eeuwen ago, in the North African decade to dance in malight to dear malight to dance in malight to dance in sack-sack.
Oren and hours and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always amazing because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, it happened to be a very hundred of them.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you've ever seen with that, you've ever seen a performer.
It was like the time and the dance and the dance and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights -- but now I was now focused on the whole thing together.
And he was not a sudden just a human beings a human human beings
In him of him above him glous.
A goddly furing him.
And if something called the stuff, knew people what it was Dan started claping them and claps, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God."
Because that was for them.
And by the way, a fun of historic fact, when Moren South South Spange, they brought this one used to do this one with me.
The require is eatched by the century of the century of "Allah" in "Olene, Olene, oil, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, OK, oh, OK, oh, Allah" in "Allah."
And that you hear today today at the time at flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments today.
If an artistic in Spain something impossible, or magically, "Allah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, all the time, Allah, right, "Allah, violene, right?
As require, a glimpse of God.
And recions what we need to have.
Lasty is the dance of the dance of the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the dinary of 11 o'couldn't god-hours in the morning lad-morning lads.
And at that moment he is a little elder man with the elder guy who may never have to come to such a lot of them will never come to such a little bit.
Maybe there is never going to be somebody who's dancing in dancing of the dancing of the dancing of the made.
What does it have to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really hard to seleck a creative mind.
But as painful it doesn't be too to be not to be too around.
Imagine that you don't go from the most extraordinary aspects of your person from your person from yourself.
Imagine that you believe them to be a while, you know, a while,
When you are ready with it, they become gives to somebody else else.
And so it is how to be a consider.
I hang inequal to the average of the mind.
The last months I've been working on a book that will be able to shifar as a lot of too long time to go to a lot of too long time to be removed to be extincluding out of the last months of the last months of the last months of the last months of the
The follower of the illuster progress.
And if my mind to go to the hall, I like to go and the same on: Don't be a bit of the same thing.
Do just you work.
just the way you do things, whatever it is.
If you are task to dance your task.
If the god-genius genius is decide to make in your work at some time at a few moment of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wheel"
And it doesn't explain thank you very much.
And then then, "Oly!"
I believe that of hard.
"Olen!" is how we have pure human love and propertly, equality by stay and propertly, by staying plums.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I had been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean, and the discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology to the digitalize, and now we try to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology and synthesize and synthesizing and synthesizing the biology of life.
So we always have tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand the too different levels of biologists have tried to understand a lot of biologists have tried to understand the whole whole thing that is a lot of biologists have tried to understand the whole thing that is a lot of biologist?"
We tried different approaches to bring different approaches to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years, it now 20 years,
When we have sequenced the human genome genome of the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask and ask to create life -- can we create life creating out of this digital universe is this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can be a kind of that can connect itself in a laboratory of a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory genitalium.
And we tried to look at whether we can come to a nature genome can come to be a nature genome of genome to be a nature genome of genome can come to a nature of a nature of smaller genome to a nature of a fla.
We can go to the order of hundred genes from the 500 or who's 500 or who's there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is relatively simply compared to the inside.
And I mean, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can check per piece of the genes that this would be a living cell cell cell cell that this would be a living cell cell of the genes that we can do a living cell the genes that could be a living cell the genes that could be a living cell cell cell the gen
And we decided to do that the only route condition was to synthesize this chromosome, so we could actually deal with the components to the components to can make the components to can make the components to can ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions, "Can we started a chromosome, "Can we started chromosome?"
Sat the chemistry, to make this very big molecules that we never have seen before,
And, if we can a chromosome, "recophis' mind?
A chromosom, by the way, is but a piece of chemical inds material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is accelated exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write razzy, but is advanced accession.
And our last point it would put in this moment in a exponential curve.
We're over 15 years ago, we started to have over 15 years ago.
There were some stages for a couple of stadisconnected to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult --
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making 30 to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of more fistakes are more fals.
So we had to make a new method for the conclude of these little pieces and corrigation of all the errigeration of all the errigeration of all the front of the errigation of all the fales.
And this was our first poging, to start the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death that bacteria deat.
We designed the chicks, the chicks, the fout-correction
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we stop a piece of chemical strain the bacteria and the bacteria called the genetic code and viral particles went and virral particles went to make a making pieces of the engineering of the bacteria --
The viral particles were going to be taken out of the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they can do that model is model but all too well fast.
They laugh more than you, you know,
And so we think this is a situation that is a situation in a software is building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 feetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes to be focus so we could various cassettes --
to understand what the actual components of a living cell cell cell is a living cell cell to understand what the reality are
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that has to be very digital information in the computer than that are really accuraf.
When we first did this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard precision is a 10,000 basepares.
And eventually we found the resequencing 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence than it was not able to start starting to start starting to start starting to start to start to start to start to start to start to get to starting to start to resequencing.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters are going to be a long time that are 50 letters to build a 50 letters to build collect sub-on--one sub-on--one sub-one thing that we need to design so that they can go together to build together to build together
We design here is unique parts in the fact in the fact of the parts in the world.
Maybe you have read that we have to stop waterms.
Bet, we have a four-liter-genetic code: A, C, G, and T.
Trios of those letters code for ruw-a-a-trade -- that there's a very one touch of every aminoxy-oxy-oxy-oxy-oxy-oxy-oxy-oxy-oxy-oxy-oxy-oxy-o-o-purpose -- there's a little bit of the w
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sense, sense, mind.
And we just asked me to be a deal of signment.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and put together and together together.
And we started to make pieces of the stuff that are five to 7,000 feeding to 7,000 letters were to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 feet than 24,000 feet than sets 2,000.
In every stage in every stage of the stuff so that we could sequences them because we could create them because we want to create a process that is very robuying to create a process of you see straight -- that you can see straight if you can see straight ight them sequences to sequences that we could sequencing them sequencing sequencing them to sequencing a process of the
We try to achieve the point of automatiseration.
So this is what this looks like a basketball finale.
And as soon as we come to the real pieces -- more than 100,000 bases, they don't grow that easily more in E. coli.
That explains the most of the modern tools of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to get to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-o-combination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair DNA can feet.
Here is an example.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radio durans that three million radiation of radiation to radiation of radiation
And that you can see that in the board panel, sopm is just just out of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he put it down the other one, exactly as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that arounds aries.
These organisms can be drought to be drood.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space that can be able to move the space that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA is a lot of the way, that there's a lot of it,
Here is a real microphones that we have made the molecule that we have made with this processes -- actually actually actually with this processes with just yesterday, with the right designer that we did them.
And it turns out that she automatically.
This is not an electron-microscope photograph, this is a microscope.
It's such a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we extend to explain the way of the audience that we spent ungs.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by humans, with a clear structure.
The molecule is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then there is 142 pages to the genetic code the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code.
Now, how do we started a chromosome? How do we started to go to this?
And it's a virus is the clearly pretty easy.
And a bacteria is much more complicated
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, as well, you just know the cell and do another one and do another one and do another one and do another one in and that's what you know when it been.
In the bacteria species is the chromosome, but we have a full transplantation of the cell, but we have a full transplantation of a chromosome of transplantation of a cell transplantation of a cell to another onother, and can activvity.
We have a chromosome species of a microbs species of a microbs.
These are about as far from each other, as people and muized people.
We feed some extra genes so that we could select for this chromosome.
We have the touched with enzymes to make all the eggs to make all the eggs to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the gas to make all the gate.
And it was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you'll be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome.
We even thought he would come to talk about it to the process of the process of developing a process of process to develop the process of what is going to be further to develop the process of what further is going to be further out of the further from it.
This is an essential evolutionary mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have remained a second chromosome of thousands of character or a thousands of qualities in one times, and add species.
People that evolution is proposed to evolve to change in the same way of ally.
There are enzymes that are restrict enzymes that are actually entered DNA that actually defining DNA
The chromosome was not going to have it was not going to have it.
The cell -- the chromosome that we put -- well.
And it was expression, and the other chromosome, and the other chromosom, and so we finally had the cell of the new chromosome.
He was blue because he was blue the genes we had stop in it.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the one species of the one species of the species of one species of the new software that we in the cell software that we in the cell in the cell of the cell software that we were stop in the cell of the new software that we stop in the cell of the new software that we in the cell of the new software that we stop in the new software that we in the cell in the
All proteins changed the membranes changed the genetic code -- when we had changed the genetic code in which it was changed.
This is a making like genomic, but we are in the software changing the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change.
Good, I paid that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is a front of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of new species of scale and based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it needs to what is needed is.
We're going to go into se-a-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet---
for each of us who lived in 1946, in 1946, that will be four ar.
We have a hard with food with food of clean water, medicine, drugs, fuel for the six-a-half billion.
And that is really really really to do that for nine to do that for nine to do that for nine
We use five billion tons of colles, more than 30 billion of oil,
That's 100 milos of five per day.
When we take biological processes in the ogency or what process process than also to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
And then of course, there's all the carbon dioxide of the fast that is in the atmosphere is going to be able to the atmosphere.
And by the world -- we have a database of the global discoveries that we have a database as the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had only a dog different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of there is forward to diversity over there.
We are predicted by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have a techniques of the gricultural methods to do combination called combination genomics to do combination genomics to do combination genomics to do something like this.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about 20 million different genes of genes and try to optimalizing processes to make octan octang-producing or medicine or drugs, new vaccins, we can change with a small team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years, then we can change the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for living fatbuly, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real designer is a screen to work on the getting and a new kind of a new kind of thing that we can actually design and a new kind of a new kind of on the computer can design a new kind of a new species of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer and a new species of the computer of what is real design.
We don't know how it will look at it.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus on fourth generation of fuels.
And the same thing that is the foundation, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuels that will come out of sugar, until more higher fuels like octan octan occasions, like octano.
But the only way we think of the way we think of biology can have a big food and make the available and the availability to lay the available is when we start with CO2 as his food as his food provided to design cells that way to design and think we are the first generation of the first generation of the first generation of fuels and we think we have the first fourth generation in about 18 months of months and to have a defied to have to have about 18.
Sunlight and CO2 is is one method -- but by our global discoveries of the global discoveries of all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the depth of a depth of deep, in cost temperatures, at cost temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with the molecular hydrogen as energy sources as energy sources.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 -- which can be pipipels to factory fab, where that can be CO2 to fromed CO2 to fueling this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we're able to expanding the basal question: "What is life?"
We have real, you know, we have the dealing goal the petrochemical industry.
Yeah, if you can't do this at TED -- where?
A important energy source is becoming a major energy source of the energy source of energy source.
But we also work on the tools of these tools to think about quickly service of vaccines in the front of the tools of the tools of these tools to think about it.
This year was the flu, we always walk like the facts like the facts of the facts when it comes to the right vaccine,
I think that can change that change from textile combined vaccines to make combined vaccines
And here you see how the future can see how the future is going to change the evolution is changing evolving evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still far away from people.
And our goal is to ask that we make a chance to survive for a long enough to survive that might be able to do that might be able to do that a long time.
What I want to show you as a first quickly, is fundament to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment in which you can lock local or at distance with immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at a lot of gigabytes to digital images and can stay in this room is going to stay and the sorter and the sorter and the sorters to our wishes.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big this collections or images or images or images are images or images
Most of this normal digital camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapix.
It's all nothing from because the only thing that the prestations would be influence in a system of system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a completely book, a completely book,
This is the graug house by Dickens. Every cold is a headd-to-of-chapter chapter --
To evidence that it's really texty, and not a imagination, we can do something to do -- to show that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a strange of a strange way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't do it to the point.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a substance of a substance of the substance of a substance of the substance of a substance of the substance of a substance of the substance of a substance of a substance of the substance of a substance of the substance of a substance of the substance of a substance of
This is really a really fun, and the experience of a real papers of papers or newspaper, which is actually a scale membering medium is.
We also have done something that we have done something that has done with the garden.
We have a np adversion of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertion -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information --
If you want to see the opportunities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can actually do the limitations of hands through the screen of the screen at the screen of the screen of the screen of the constraints of the screen of the constraints of the screen of the screen of the constraints of the ideas can do the screen of the ideas we can do the screen of the ideas can do the screen of the constrainft.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups and other things that means and other flaw -- not needed to be more than it is not necessarily to be more than it -- not needed to be more population and other things that means and other things that means and other things that doesn't have any more be.
Of course are a nation of agricultural for a technology like this, I will spend up to a technology like this, I won't spent time to this field to this field of a lot of a lot of a bath of a lot of contribute to a lot of a bulp,
These are all the roads in the U.S.
on top of the NASA image of the NASA
Let's look at something else to something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques connected together.
One of them is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision research by Noah Seitzy promozed, promoting by Steve Seitz at University at University at University at University at University at University of University at University of Washington,
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A beautiful conversation.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we see this -- you see that we see through the images and the multi-resolution and the multi-resolution resolution --
The space shakes of the images has this been here to the images is here
The computer vision algorithms have these images together to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of these things are genomes of diasws or images, or images, or all these things are spacecrafic diasws and all these things are space -- and all these things are space -- and all these things are space -- and all these things are space -- and all these things are spent
I don't know whether there is time, other environments.
There are a lot of space matcher that are still a lot of space.
I want to show one of the Noah's original data -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we worked in my head is the reality of the engineering of this technique, the reality of the engineering of this technique, at the environments to our website.
We had to do it with the lawyers, and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for images from Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you can just get images of the Notre Do Did in Flickr.
And each of these orange chirs gives a image that model turned out to be part of this model --
And so these are all these Flickr images that are spent in this way space --
And we can do a simple way to touching in a way of way to fignore
You know, I never had thought I would never work, to work at Microsoft would work to work
It's overwhelming to be so until to be able to be so unfortune.
I believe that you can see that this many types of cameras -- everything from gsm to mirrors a lot of thir-flexcameras, a lot of these, in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange a strange images
There are so much working about faces and things like this.
And somewhere in this is even a series of photos -- this is here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also chured by the program.
If we have the poster in the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data of everybody -- from the whole collective secret of the entive sear, the Earth, the Earth -- and headpleasurament.
All these photos are becoming together and forming together a whole bit bigger than the parts.
You have a model that is a model that entire Earth is the whole Earth of the entire Earth
So as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that growing in complexity when they use the prevents of the advantage of people who use it.
Their own pictures are being present to metap?
If somebody would want to clip and their names and their names and their names and their names is removing the Notre Dame is require to all those data, and then I can use as a access to the space, which is using metap, and create a metapa ver, and create create a kind of cross-modale, and created social experience.
And of course, is the be-product of this immense of a virtual model of any interesting place on Earth, which is not only from the air photos, satellite images and other applications is a collective telling -- but also the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what you can make a software possible on a day, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are being died by everybody in the world can copy in the world together can copy?
BA: Yeah. What this is really doing is discovering.
It creates to your wise, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the foundation in the images.
And that is a remember, which is exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information which is accelerating these images across the far dom of these images across the wealth of these images across the wealth of semantic information which is access.
When you look for images, you look for images, you feel a search of the webpage and the text on the webpage of information about what the image imagination about what the image imagination.
What if you have this image is a copposed to all your images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of that, from that comes out of that, it's a classical networking effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasure and of enographic research is the possibility to live between those who are the old living in the wind, which are still feel in the wind, the touched strain the wind, the touched stones, the profitting in the wind, profitting parents of the bitter-toothing, profitting the parentnerships.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still traveling the Milky away or that the myths of Inchecks of Inchecks with meaning to the Himalay still working on the breaths still make the aths of Dhars still make your food in the breath, you remember, the world we live in an absolutely lives in an absolutely of the anthropology, but is not just one model of the real model of the real model of the work,
the consequence of a fun set adaptation choices that made our ancestors generations ago.
Of course, we all share all the same appull: World Brengors. Brengors. Brengors. Breng children in the world.
We all make all inform inforces of in-in-in-stuff.
And as the including disappoint,
So it can't be a surprise that we all all all of them, dances and art art.
But interesting is the unique cadans of the song and the rhythm of the dance in any different culture.
Or now is to the Penan in the wolden at Borneo, or the Vood-Seolites in Haii, or the Caisut in North Kaisut in North Kaisut in the Andes-build Curch in the Sahara. This is the Carai in the heart of the Sahara. This is the dealt of the Sahara. This is a map -- or a maago.
Everest, the goddedt of the world.
They all all us that we can be able to think different, can think of the Earth can be oriented.
And if you think about it, this idea you can only give you a lot of it.
Samen forms the intelligent cultures in the world of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural life that is the biological life: the biosphere.

What voodoo is so interesting is the living between the living and dead the lives, and the death of living and the death of life,
The living bars the spirits.
The minds can be able to be touched under the Great Water, answering the dance of the living at the life of the living at the time to the living at the time as that one becomes a little bit of the god.
And so that is why is fooism says, "You go to the church and talk about God.

The young acolites are becoming away at their families when they are three or four are three or four ar.
They are become sun-understanding in a world of dark in a world of foot in foot of glacs, 18 years.
Two periods of nine years, conscious to month the nine months of shaping the nine of their mother.
Now they're in front of the flaw of the big mother.
These whole time they are being creating the society values that are the attention in the behaviors that only high-an-o-or ecologicically, or ecologicically, -- balance in the state of the cosmic or ecologically.

What does that mean that mean? It means that a little child from the Anths, which is a mountain a creating Apu-mind is that the mountain a fundamental other people, and another relationship to the ground, and another relationship to the front than a small child from Montana, a small kid with the idea that the mountain a little bit of mine.
Or it the living of a mind or a lot of this: is irrelevant.
And interesting is the metaphor that the define the contention between the individual and natural world.
I was grown in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were craff that these fores were to become a cross-crasses of the idea that these forests were to be crasses to be crasses to be craff that these forests were going to be crasses there were couple of the fores of British Colummbia with the idea that these forests of the idea that these forests of the idea that these forests of the idea that these forests of the idea that these forests of the idea that these bosing Britickages of the idea that these forests of the idea that these forests of the idea that these forests of the idea that these forests were ces were had had had had had had had had
And that made me another human beings than my friends of the Kwagiulgiant -- who believe that those boses the forests of Kuxwhukw and the Kromm Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromm and the cannibal mindswaling around the world far-friends of the world far-friends that was born from the north of the world and the cannifed of the Cwagiul-while, and the Kuxemel and the Kuxwhuxes of the Kuxicemeal mine of the Kuxic, and the Kuxile of the Ky of the Kile of the Ky of the Sgengengengengengengengengengengengengenux, and the Kuxic.
These minds are important during their Hamatsa-in-inducation.
And if you start to understand the idea that these cultures can create different realities can be understanding to get to get some of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discoveries --
It's a picture I apreflect in the North Amazon nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive representation of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating ayahhome is not just the farmacological potential to it, but how it was connected from two sources of two sources of sources.
And so, there's a wooden that is a wooden carbuline, hearmine and harmine and heart hallucinating light hallucinating works.
If you take the plant far, it seems that a blue room by your consciousness statisfy by your consciousness.
The plant is being mix is mix-like coffee beades from a coffee --
The plant squarter tryptamines, narrow re-brain serotonine, dimethyltryptamine, which is 5-methoxyltryptamine, and methyltry-ptamine, destine.
Have you ever seen the Yanomami when they snuts, that substance of different species that are substance of different species that are also substance of methoxyltry-too?
And that poeder your nose in blads, as a past pulling path, protedered with baro-pictures, to countries in a sea of electricity. This ship, is not a disings of reality; the ship, the creature; it creates the represence of the reality
I tried to my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince a man who did the psycheultance in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was paying that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect are involved involved in the hallue to experiences. Tryptamines are not to take oral hallucination in the human dar, because they are from a single in the human darm-muloxiday.
They can only be orally being an oral entremendous with something that the monoamine of sun-purpose.
The fascinating is that the beta-carbolines in the lian apo-sum suppression to activate the tryptamin-supply ptamin-body's gorfly, how can this follow in a flor-morphological variant species that are actually two morph-follow?
We say eufemistic "trial and ror, which is a meaning levels is a meant called a meaningle-mask.
The Indians say, "The Indians talked to the uns.' What does is that stem mean? This stem the Cofan, 17 variants of ayahhome of ayahhome of ayathca, who can identify all the large distance of the eyes would be able to identify as one species would have to identify --
If you ask their question to how they get their task in the task of plants saying a plants of the plants of to know what happens
You know a whole thing like this?" I said, "no."
And it turns out to be all the 17 species in a night in a night in a night in different toonlads.
You don't promovates to Harvard, but it's a piece of a lot of tells.
Now, the problem is that even those of the ones of those sympathic people, and color, they have them as a curious and color, but reduced them as a curious and color, but reduced to a foot the real world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember the 20th century to be war, or his technological innovations, but before, as the age that we stonished and active participipes of biological and cultural diversity to the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity of biological and cultural diversity. The problem not change.
All cultures always have a dance of new life opportunities.
And technology is not the problem is not the problem of the problem.
The Sioux-indians are not Sioux -- when they were their pil and tree, just as min when they stop Americans stop Americans are stop Americans and way?
It's not changing or technology that is the integrity of the enos:
The wrapped face of government.
And what you see in the world, you will notice the fate of these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living following are being received by identify further to their apply opportunities that are addresses.
Or this is to the huge deforestation in the home of the Penan, a nomadication in the home of the Penan, a nomadical that to the forest, and the last generation in the forest, and now now is reduced to services and prostitution to the river, and prostitution to the river, where you can see that the river, and prostitution to the Sup-Chinese Suue-Chinan-South Chinese Suuuea, to the questifth Chinese CCCCa Sulple of Chinese Soundurpoin-Chinese C:

In the case of the Yanomami are the disease that are involving as a result of discovery of the discovery of discovery of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of research government.
Genocide, the physical extraordinary is a full universal require, but enockid, the destruction of living of a people, but becomes not just a lot of region, but in a lot of a developmental areas.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level, until you get to the basic level,
I have a young colleague 9,000 kilometers about country of Chengdu in West China to Lhasa.
And as I came to Lhasa in Lhasa behind the statistics that you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destruction, 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.
The dad of my colleague was acknown to the Panchen Lama.
And at the basis on that he was killed at the Chinese invasion of that he started to kill direct directly

His mother was a prisoning because she was rich because she was rich rich was rich in the same time.
He was the prison the prison when he was two -- he was hidden under her rock, because they don't have him without her rock.
The sister that held as hero-h-smokle in a commoned in a reflect skamp in a common.
And one day she staper to a poor, she got a poorer of Mao. For this over-over-year-old seven years, they were seven years,
The pain of Tibet can be untouch, but the following spirit of the people.
And eventually it comes to a choice.
Would we want to go to a gray world or would we want to live a colorful world of diversity in diversity?
The great anthropologist, for her death said to her death that she was a general member, amorf world image across the amorf world image across the same anthrow of the same anthrow that we can do a global anth,
We wouldn't just see the human imagination are constrained to a small, but also we would have to have a melt and forgotten that there are other options are also other options of the options of the things that are also other options of the opportunity to a small of the imagination of the human imagination is that there are other opportunities to a small,
We can feel our kind of a sense that our species are about [150.000] years, on Earth is about the earth of the earth is about the idea that our species is about [150.] years.
The Neolitic Revolution, who gave our agriculture of the seed-side, when the shaman was replaced by the shaman was replaced by the prosham of the priests and we had a deft by specialization and we had a dealization by a 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years.
This surface history is not gives me the idea that we have all the answers that we have all the answers that the next millennia to our path.
If the intelligent cultures of the world to humans are asked to people, answers to 10,000 different voes.
And it's in that song that we will find the opportunity to be able to be what we are, a people, which is a people, which is all the people, and all the gars to make all the garden and all the garden of optimism.
This picture I have this picture in the northern point of Baffin Island taking the Inch, when I went to Inextensive you.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextinction of the 195, to focus in the 195, to focus in nder-setttings.
The opa of Olayuk to go to go.
The family of his life and ontance for his life and ontand, all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inuit not afraid for the col; they use it to col; they use it
The glasses of their behind originally made from fish in carrying fish in carbs.
Olayuks up, not afraid for the polar or the storm that was high.
He went out to outside, he was living from sea hundred of sales and poeping the pow-began to woman he started freezing womeless, he started it as a living to woman, he started a living to womeless, he started a living out of his hand.
And he brought a low-to-behaving speeking.
When the solid was solid to slaught a dog of dog --
He met the dog and improvised a heart and improvise a hear.
Of the ribs he made a bad thing.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood and disappears about the ice flake, including pages
And what is not going to come around with nothing to do is symbol for the resistance of the Inuit and all the income and all the income and all the income all the time.
In april 1999 was the Canadian government the Inuit the complete control population of a piece of country larger than California and Texas California and Texas a Nunavut.
It's independent. They region. They reverse all the soil stones.
It's a amazing example of how a nation enough enough to her people can by.
And finally, I think it's clear to this uithen, at least for who is at this uithoes of the world is that they actually don't actually have all away to this way.
They're somebody who are somebody called a country.
They are going to be able to the human imagination, which is going to the beginning of time. And for us all the time. And for us all the dreams of these kids, just like the unsea of un-in-graphy separate geography of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely the idea that politicians never reached to the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic, we think that a polemic, but we believe that stories can change the world that stories can change the world that we probably the best tell tell the best tell you the best tell you the best tell is that the best tell you a game in the world is -- we are in 156 million times in 156 countries in 156 countries in a million-public.
We make a felt to travel to the food, with our public, with our audience, to such a very extraordinary cultural places, where the toeschemed by what he seeing in the most important baring bars to extremely extremely required to exists in a multic world that we can find a way to live in a multiculate in a multiple world and pluralistic world and plual world of pluralistered world
which all the wisdom of all the people, can contribute to our sementally well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question of a question of question that I have a book in a book of a book of questions.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explain some of the connect that you might have been a little bit of you might have been able to do a little bit of a display of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a display of a little bit of a connect to you.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma, in-industrialized society.
And that official dogma is aid louds the well: Om the well-free of our citizens on the highest level of our citizens, we need to give them so much, we need to give them so much as possible individual freedom of our citizens,
Freedom is a big good good dead, an essential part of the human exist.
And the top of the top of us to treat the way to treat its own inses, to reach a higher well-free and reach a higher without inment,
The ultimate freedom we sea opportunity.
More choices like that people have more freedom of people have more freedom
And more freedom means automatically.
This is so deep getting in our society that no one would requires that nobody would have to do it.
And in our lives is this dogma, this dogma.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressing.
No one of those 175 changes are in my supermarket teaches are in my supermarks, in my supermarks, and twal-virgin o's acual bas as a lot of bas as a though balthough balthough balth,
And then you can make a task of your own threats for the case between 175 species for the 175 species for you, nothing to you.
So that's the attempt of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can make your stereoset -- loud of the stronger -- loud speakers, cassettesple -- radio, radio, a stronger.
And in the one electronics you can choose out of this attacks.
You can do it a lot of these are and a million different systems, with parts of that store.
Five -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young ago and you could have all sorts of phones and ask all kinds of Ma Bell.
You were going to do it. You don't bought it.
And that was the way the advantage that it never happened to be a piece of it.
And that time is fore."
Today there are a lot of different applications of different across it.
And in order to cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with behind behind the high making fun and crative fun break brander.
And you don't have this model that model in the wincle in the wincle in the wincle that happens to be able to be that happens.
The consequenc: people come to the wincle and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question is the answer, you know how the answer to that question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile of buying too much do.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the attack-having stuff, is this explosive explosive is this explosive is a fact.
Gealth care, it's not the United States is not as you go to the doctor and that you go to the doctor, and that you have to do what you need to doctor what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A doctor, or we can do B to do B to do, or we can do B to doctor, and says, "We can do B to doctor, and says, "We can do B to doctor, and says, "We can do B doctor,
A front of this and, and after sharing this forward.
The one is this front and tasking?"
And you say, "Do kter, what does you find out of what does you find out of the thing?"
And the doctor says, "A front and the front and the springs and naddles.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do kter, if you was like, what would you do it?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own inbrings of the patient."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision of a devices of things -- the doctor -- the doctor -- to a life's freezing a seem, and not the best condition to take a decisions, and not the best condition to take a lot of recepipments are being made a lot of advances is a lot of advanced far reclap-ced member.
Good consisted that ners, because the goal group, because the goal group, you can't buy them.
Why do do do if we can't buy do it --
Because they think we think that we think the next morning our doctor to ask the doctor to ask that other making the other making measure.
Our identity is a pricing aspect of our exists is now over-focused on choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is the background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want.
Every morning to the emergency in the emergency to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family family, the family.
There is a time that you know, I was going to have all the way to do you get so fast as possible to kids so quickly as possible to kids beginning.
The only choice was a little bit of who, not when and what you did was doing was doing it.
Now free everything for the opportunity to the opportunity.
I left at a particular intelligent students, which I have done is at least percent.
They are not a vice, or in the early of the early time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Do I would say, whether or not? Do I married now?
Or will I wait? Do I first children, or a care?"
These are all single questions.
They go through to them to have an answer, as this means that they don't have all their homework and not care and by that they don't get a good number.
And they have the same thing to do is importantly,
And then we come to work with work. Carl just all that technology is to work every minute of every minute of every day. And in the world where in the world is also -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, by the way, which I love secret that I love secret it.
I don't walk like I don't want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that we are looking at the sea freedom of work in that we are behind to ask ourselves and then we go to and we'll work or not.
We can look at a football disappoint, and we can look at one side, and our Blackberry on one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and may our laptop on the other side, and may our laptop on the other side, and may be our laptop on the other hand.
And even if they all get out of all the time of the tells of all kinds of all kinds of questions, "Am I ask this phone, "Am I recognized this phone, "Am I think of this phone, and we are all the time.
Am I response to this email -- I write this letter --
And even if the answer is "Nee" is, we experience the football disappoints of our son's son in a whole different way.
Where we also look at the large, the small -- the small stuff, the materialistic things, life is a question of choose of choos;
And so the world was the world used to be saw the world to the world --
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choos;
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about is that I want to talk about what is bad to talk about it.
And that huge choices has two effects, two effects, two effects on humans.
A very contradiction is that the earlier is that the earlier.
And so many choices of choices people are the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example, a research to investments in volunted-plans.
A colleague of mind access to investment data from Vanguard, a great policy created with about one million employees of about 2,000 employees about 2,000 fings.
They found that for any 10 policies that for any 10 policies that the worked far adapted the particular two percent degree dish --
And in five-foundations did 10 percent less employees than five percent of emergency in five than five and five founds. Why?
Because it is a fifth of five-foundations so hard to choose that people just choose the choice to the next day, and that I think -- and that I put it on it, and so forth.
And from exposed to the point is deal.
That doesn't mean that doesn't just mean that people don't have any dream of eating because they have not enough money because they have not enough money to eat the choice as a lot of choice as well as they have to shoot the choice of them to shoot the choice of the work-separate for eating that they have to shoot the choice as we have to have a lot of
And they had to go to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose nose forward.
The worked about, the worked to disappoint.
So too many choices can be a lover, so much choices work.
And I think the world is that the world looks like this.
If it goes to the century is to the right choice mas, right?
You don't want to be a wrong with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
And that's the first effect. The second thing is that we had the lost of the dish of our dish and choose choose and choose are end, eventually less touched by the result than the case, if we had less options have had less options as we had fewer options of the first effect.
There are multiple reasons for to feet.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tasy focus that the choice was not perfectly the choice was not perfect.
You put you in this case, you put in this case, would have been better --
This is dreamed alternative cars to get your choice.
And so, the follow-co-foldo--foldos you have made a good choice that you were made a good choice choice of the choice that was a good choice that you were a good choice that you were a good choice that you were making the choice that you had a good choice you, even if it was a good choice choice that you had a
How more options are there are too easier to have a fashion is the unfashion the gets of the gets of option.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave all of how often we depend the value of things that we make them equal things that we equal them.
If you can invent many alternatives you can see many alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives that you deft the enternatives you off.
That makes you fewer task that you have chose with the alternative that you have chose --
A example, the non-New Yorkers under you, my excuses.
This is a little bit the stretch of this example.
This is a state in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second wound.
They are at a beautiful strand. Stralend again.
Don't be right? "Don't be carrying man, "It's augor, "It's augor.
Everybody in my neighborhood, Manhattan is the city of the city.
I could do my car for the door for the door for the door parkers."
And he is two weeks to size two weeks to the idea that he has a great parking place.
And the foundly of the fold-fold-fold-choice choice, even if we make a great choice choice choice.
The more opportunities are too more retrickable alternatives are there.
And those presenting to us as substitution costs.
Another example.
This image stories to a number of stories to a number of points.
Life in the right here, and now for example, and you don't need to get things to get to consider things.
And one point is that you can do with any choice other choices of choices
And all of the other has so his attractive option to the gecost option is eating the option is less attractive to be equality in the other one.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this was my search for a new bree-foot for a new breezing new greenhouse
I turn away out to get it to be spirit --
By hold, but one kind of stuff, and that bought you know, the path, it doesn't make it was incredibly uncomfortable unately, but if you the greenhouse enough and often enough enough and often enough enough and often enough enough enough to be the bad enough and often enough it was a lot of them --
And after years I went to the wincle for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to do a just."
And the winkely said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fith or relaxed fith or relaxed fit said, "Wilt you can fit -- "Welt you smart fith or relaxed fith or relaxed fity?
Do you whether or a rhyth? Whilt you were stone-washed or acid?
Do you want to close a behind of the tack?
Do you can check a little bit of pipes, or flink expanding pit." And so he went through it.
I was spoke of it. And I was spoke to me the one while, I said, "I want to be the only one."
He had no idea which was not a idea which was and so I have a long hour for a long hour for a long time to passed in the model.
And I was very honest, I was a store exploited with a exploited blowing bate.
I could have done better time. I could have done to do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To explain this one, I wrote a book for myself,
The reason I don't feel better with all of the choice, was that I started expecting to expect a good speech, was that I started expecting a good speed-by-blowing away from a good speech,
I started without any expectation, because I just just one kind of spirit of a spirit knows a lot of the spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit,
And then there was different different wars, and one of them would be perfect.
What I was a good good -- but not perfect.
And so I read my greenhouse to my expectations, and that asked me teleur.
How more opportunities people have to expect more expectations of the deserve of those opportunity.
And that means people are less totally beyond the results are less of the results are being good results.
Marke-ings don't know this is not know?
Because you don't know that case I know what I'm talking about today.
In the real thing is about that it goes to be about it.
Everything was bad when everything was bad at the time.
Because when everything was bad was bad to people have a lot of surprising experiences.
In our modern society is that we can as well as well as a well of perfection, but the best we can ever reach to what we can ever reach to be so good as we had to have to be so good as well as we had to be.
Never we become surprise to be surprising -- my expectations, and torengages, torend.
The secret of happiness -- for you to have all this -- the secret of happiness is not too much expect to be too much expectancy --
I want to do -- I want to do a car-biographic element, I am with a woman who is really fantastic element,
I don't have a less too. I had a less tested at least
But with less enough nine has a good opportunities.
And finally, when you get a bad at the bad of the bad is a bad like this, but one kind of presidentify -- you can ask the question of why you can do the question of why you are untouching the air --
The answer is that case is that case a case simple thing.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different cars available and you buy to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer is just as simple. That's just as simple.
You had a better choice choice can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different works you don't have a excuse to fale.
So if people decided to take people to decide the results of those decisions, they are teleurated over their choice.
And they take themselves them qualities.
In the Western society clinical depression in the younger generations of high generations of high time.
A factor -- not the one -- not the end, but a significant factor in this explosive increase of depression and suicide self-suicide experiences are of their high expectances of their high expectations.
And if they try to explain to explain to explain itself, they give themselves, they give themselves the ded.
So the nettoress, so the nettoress, so that we actually actually actually feel objective to fellow the bad of it.
Another a summary of contained again.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be able to attacks.
But that's not.
It doesn't suffering a twice, it doesn't choose better than not can choose feeling out of that, but it doesn't automatically choose that is more choice is even better is more choice is even better than any any other thing.
There's a magic ground-foundly to choicice-founds. Well I don't know.
But I know that we are all for long time to the point that choices us are being secretation of well-behavior.
Now there's a principle, I'm almost ready -- a principle, which we can keep the best to keep the best of the best to do it.
The choices in industrialized countries is prevent countries are prevent from material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about where the problem is not so much choice is not too much choice, but right there is too little choice is too much choice is too much choice as we have heard before.
So the paradox I speak to the moderne, so the moderne, which is a moderne, which is a kind of flam.
That's frustrers, and I think of this is Steve Levitt has been told that expensive and instally. Sund your mind is not helping kids are not helping your money.
I say you about this duntil thuic, complicated choices -- they don't help to: they focus to, they focus to damage.
They make our lives less value.
If a part of what people in our society in our society to make all those choices to make all the opposite of people have to have countries to have countries to have all opposed to get people on it.
And also we have to go forward forward.
That's what economists is a Pareto-concerned better than a Pareto-connection --
Everybody is better by reverse from reverse -- not just poor people -- and that is not just poor people -- and that comes from the choices we with with our of the choices we with with our behavior.
And finally, if you read this image story -- you read this image of a separate whatever know?
Nothing is possible in a fish commission."
A scrale example, a short global imagination, a very quickly interpretation.
But the longer I took about it, I understand that this fish I understand that this fish is a deeply defined to be smart.
Because in fact, there's this one is the hand: If you fish the fish to create opportunities to create opportunities you don't have a freedom on-lamining.
If you get the fish case to create opportunities to create opportunities.
It leads to more lost and less and less acception.
Everybody has a fish for a fish to a fish of the way
This is free to refer -- possible even for the fish.
But the seatence of a figure of figure-fishing is to ask questions to ask is a display --
Thank you for your attention.
