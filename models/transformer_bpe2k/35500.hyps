Last year I showed these two dias, to show that the pooly capture capture capture cape, which had been the last three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the serious problem because it doesn't show the disconnect to see the disgusting of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The Worth Pole, the North Pole, in a way, is the sheart of our global climate system.
It turns out in the summer and crop in summer.
The next slide I showed is a acceled version of what happened the last 25 years of what happened happened in the last 25 years of what happened in the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years of what happened in the slides of what happened the slidea that I show.
The permanent ice is purpose in red.
Like you see it down to darkly blue.
That's the annual ice during the winter.
And the crazy.
The so-called permanent, five years or older, or older, is almost like blood, that from the body so-taken down here.
In 25 years of this is going to this to this forward this to this forward.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen ground the Northern Icell and it was a very large amount of frozen women's frozen carbon and find out of microbes that death, when the death of microbes in methane.
Commician disophistication in the atmosphere, and it could double that could double that could double as we dedub the point of the surrounds.
In some undie, in some undie, in Alaska sign methane on from the water.
Last winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another team to another undeep on a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a --
Whoo! She's OK. The question is the question is right.
A reason for that, this is that this huge "warmer Greenland from the north.
This is a meltwo-atriver.
The water volume is equal the catch is larger than equal
This is the Kangerlussize in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea soaxy because it is the landijes, this is the place where it comes into the sea.
These stroming these flew on fleg.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice mass on Earth.
Last month, scientists that has been a whole continent now that has been a negative ice balance.
More is the ice, the ice of the South Pole is in the West of melting, with south Pole is melting some of the underwater eilands.
The whole continent is for six meters sea lestying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice massa, there are new now, that a few years ago, which was still glaciers were still glaciers were still in glaciers
40 percent of the world's population is gets the help of his drinking water from that melt.
In the Andes, this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more poaching today.
But when they disappearing and the drink water.
In California, there was a 40 percent in the snowed of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions are several at the time.
This global dreams of drought has led to a dramatic stying,
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen speed.
Four times in the last 30 years of the last 30 years in the front of 75 years.
This pattern is completely untable.
If you look at the end of a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons at CO2 ton CO2 a.m.
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, look at the eastern of the Stille Ocean, and in every size of America, as, and at each side, and at each side, there is a drastic daling out there is a drastic daling oxygen in the oceans.
The only great case, the only great case, of the Earth, narrative to deforest, which is burning for 20 percent of money is burning fossil fuels.
Oil, the problem, and steencoal is the most biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extinctions, with China.
And there was a lot more coal to build a lot more coal-carbon centrals.
But we see a cirmale.
These are the coal-carbon the centrales that built was annuted in the last years, and where green alternatives.
There is a political fighting in our country.
The coal coal -- and oil industire gave industire gas to promote "Coly spot coal coal -- which is a contratraving.
And that picture was doing something like that.
Red the urbs was at home in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of literally related to belied.
You probably seen it in the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news
This is the biggest dished biggest several in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertisetions of the coin cooking was this one.
Video: "Frosty the steencarbon man is a stage, upon guy.
He's overliquid attackage here in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coal man is scanman is scannounced with the day.
He's paid and estimate and employees their job and employee."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia from day's choice from days.
The largest mines is the land is the great by's great batch of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reing, they don't know where they talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, has two campaigns on the road of two campaigns on a rock.
This is a piece of a piece of them.
Video "Be COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat for our things.
That's why the reason the way the most important goal is to give a giant engage to the light and bring the light and bring the light and bring the lower and the tricky.
Fit is, coal is not smart.
We find that the clean is -- and it still crossing it again.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
Let me just just about us.
Video: Schone coal, you heard a lot of coal, you heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shan coal-coal-coal-coal-coals.
Fantastic! The machines are making some lay some lay of lay --
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.
Despite the fact that the breaking coal one of the most important causes of the most important causes of the Earth, change the remarkable stead, the remarkable technology that you see everything.
Look at the time, this is the clean coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, past the positive alternative in our economic challenges and that in national security.
Video: Stem: America is in crisis, the economy, the national security is the national security of climate crisis.
The red about all of these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel eloil, like vills and imported oil.
But now there's a new solution to get out of this.
For America is 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get work to get a work on a plan that makes us safer and the warming of the Earth --
And in fact, a solution that is really enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Design.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Do: It's about re-powered energy.
One of the fastest ways to make an end up to our dependence of old and dismissing our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help the require.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Oh, 2: New investments to create jobs.
Voice: Repower America. Time to become realistic
Al Gore: There's an old African an old African speakings that says, "If you want to be all of the things --
If you want to go far and well, together."
We need to go far and fast;
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with a update about how that machine works.
So I'm here to those of you who didn't get it.
It has to go to needed the circumstances that were attack less than a billions of second after the universe started to be 600 million times a second of the universe was started to 600 million times a second of a second of the way to 600 million times a second of the way to 600 million times a second of the condition.
Enorm ambitius, so!
This is the machine below Geneva.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one I work with work with the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in adaptacular to see the scale.
And in 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by AS.
And that caught for a fetle,
It's a picture of the first particle jaesral that was completely around LHC, and with them up with a piece of the LHC, which has been taken in the detector in the detector in the detector flower of power.
In other words, when we knew that picture at 10 September we knew that the machine was a huge over-winner is a huge over-inside of the massion.
I don't know if this was the biggest across or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page out of the Internet page out of the way.
That means we have a little bit a cultural as a scientific impact of a scientific impact --
And we had a problem with the machine, and we had a problem with these golden behaviors.
Those wetons of 13 thousand ampeers when the machine working on the full power.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they have superaidend at the whole low-temperaturs.
So on min 271, colder than the space between the stars, that can be the behaviors that flow power.
In one of the connectivity between the nine of a thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And then the wire was wire something warmer, and was including that 13 thousand ample of ampeering 13 thousand ample of ampeers.
This was the result.
This is still impression when you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of the road, and they were about 30 centimeter were mostly going to get them to move.
We damaged to take about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did.
We all have repair of them as all the time.
Now they are back on the road.
Eind map the LHC will be again.
We will put it back and we expect measures in june or right so we can go further with the further with the building stone of the universe.
Now, of course, those unfortunately, they have started about the value of scientific research. It's easily to requency.
I think it's the fact that it's so hard to be so hard to go beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I let the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to do the decade of the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, "Nthing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind that we have an images our images of human minest than to take our images that we don't have a mysteries in the nature, and that there are no new world."
Thank you very much.
I would like to start asking you to ask back to your children at your children at your children at blocks.
When you discovered how to grab it, and they were actually taking up and conscious, you actually problems on the teaching with the engineering and hanging the hands of space relations.
Rumtely insights is very powerful, because of understanding the world to us.
If a information that if an information is inspired by the physical interaction with objects -- with my advisor Pattion and my fashion Jeevan Calanithi -- what if we would have a computer -- what if we would have a computer -- what if we would have a computer -- what if we would have a computer -- what if we would have a computer that moves on a plat individuals with individuals with individual information that is to depended physicicicicics can care of physically.
and ordering orders:
This question him was so connected to figure out a answer to figure out a answer by building Siftables.
Sort cooked is a Siftable computer is a interactive computer size of a cooky.
They can be moved, they can feel put together, they can feel their movement and they contain a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handle-blocks like blocks can get mostly move through it.
For the other other than we have a new ecosystem for the ways of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And this is that these helping resources have a more physical different, and even of the way we move and even the way we move them and even of the way we move them and fun interactions of all the way we move them and fun interactions of the way that we have to discover and fun interactions of their movement and enjoy interactions of each other
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instoned to tell a video and they have been applied by the office plays and otherso, others and others' telepted, refuture,
This interactive portraities are conscious.
Indians next to each other other place, they will interest in the interest in the world.
If they are surround, they notice and they can also be some nervous about becoming some nervous thing.
Further she feel movement, and shelling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting results of this interaction, the use of the interaction, the use of all, as it was a fluid as it was a fluid as it was a fluid of color as it was a fluid of color as it was a fluid of color as it was a liquid result of the color as it was a
In this example of three Siftables emmers for three Siftor in a emmerge of emmerged in a employment.
If we have over, we went back a little bit back a little bit back.
There are some of the couple of the education, especially playing things with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the opportunity to probt the result immediately until of the outside immediately until to see the outside.
Here's what I -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci running a simple acci account programmats.
Here we show a game that a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every Siftacked at every Sifta and shaped words on every Siftable, and shaped in a dictionary.
In about 30 seconds it is very rehab, and applies a new series of letters with behind possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I asked them it out and I asked them it and make a video.
They were actually felt away.
And one of the most interesting things that is that people don't need instructions is that people don't need instructions to have instructions
Everything you have to say is "Most word and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people at testing.
That's our young bends the right bota tester, right-hand right.
Bs it just turns out to stack the Siftables would.
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive paintingly painted here.
We wanted to develop a platform for the language of language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftable with that characters of the table.
He's going to get the sun risk.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene scene of the scene
Video: The orange tractor.
Good jan! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttables and the needle to put together and then it can respond to each other -- Video: Wake the characters with each other -- Video: Wake the characters with each other -- Video: Wath the characters to do the characters with each other -- and they can respond to the characters
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decide how it walking.
Video: The cat flying roaway.
DM: The last example I will show you to show Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed recent a sound producing sound as the lead, where every Siftles and drum.
Eender has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want.
These sounds can be injected in the emptables so you can determined the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the way, of a spring Siftile there are live controllable as reverb and movie.
They are being added to a sound and attacked by the office.
In the general effects like tempo and volume that are being taken on the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Sifttables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now I add a little bit of slagwork.
Video: DM: And now I cople the movter of the drums, so I can affect live the effect living.
Video: I can cut it very faster by the offices of the dirty blocks.
Video: DM: Now I cope the movter of the bas for the bas for the same expression.
Video: I can rescue the pattern as it is play.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything else and shorter as I want to do it.
With the dimessage the dimitted by the volume Siftable to the left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is going to make new people to make new people of new people's interfaces that are better destroy in the way our brains and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area that we have a couple of possibilities that we develop in the lab that we develop in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the attain is that this is just the attention to the interacts for the interacts for the interacts of digital media, that bring the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it out to talk to you with all of you.
I'm writing.
Buth is my work, but also writing about is work, but also so much more than that.
My entire life for writing and I don't think that will change a long time and I don't think that ever going to change that will change.
Yet, there's a little bit of a property, in my life and career, and I had to re-career, and I had to re-re-re-re-re-frigh relationship with my work and careering my work and careering with my work and careering my job has to re-careering in my work and careering with my work and careering with my
It started a book that I wrote ungs a memoire: "Et, Bidds," which is very very contrast to my earlier work on the whole world about my earlier work on the whole world about and an international exister of engineering weller and a little bit of the world was a little bit of the world was going to be a lot of the world about and a
The consequence, people now have to me and always teged me as if I did do I do do it.
So what -- -- do is domes!
People come to me and ask to me and ask ask to me that you don't afraid you could never evenar?
Don't you frightening your entire life will continue to write your whole book will publish in which people will publish heat that people will walk?
Don't you from?"
Right? Comen's scared you.
Of course, that would be very remember that I remember in about 20 years ago, I was a teenager, when I told was a teenager.
People said, "Do you don't get success that you will never get succes?
Don't you exaction, that you will go on it up?
Don't you frightening your life on this work without that there will ever be something from the bitter and that you will dievision and you will die on the puin of your broken bitter as of bitter axis of bitter ax?"
Something in that streting.
In the short, my answer is going to ask up this questions on this is "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all of those things that are called all those things that are called
All right.
But I'm also for a lot of other things afraid and you don't know what what all of the things that all.
For example, and other engine, and other engineering things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time that comes from.
Is it rationel?
Is it logical that somebody is afraid to be afraid to work for which they are to their opinion, and they have seen their opinion.
What is so that creative processes that we make worry about the effects of the effects of the mineshistory, something that in other species of working on the other species of work at the time.
Take my father. He was chemistry engineering, and I can't remember that it was asked somebody that he was ever asked somebody had asked somebody to him or he was not afraid to him or he was not afraid for it.
So of that, "John, how is it with your chemby?"
No, so it wasn't talking about it.
To be fair to be fair chemistry engineers have been not hold the reputation of manically, for piece of manical-depressive alcoholists.
Do writers writers have this reputation.
Not only writers, other creative people have been a reputation mentation mentation is mental instable.
Just look at the grimming death the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own style by own stying.
And even those who didn't seem to be suicide a suicide of their gave to be under their gave to.
In the last interview for his death said, "Donce Miler: "My each of my books is a piece of mitself."
That's a little bit about your life.
But of this kind of outspoke we don't look at that.
We all heard it all earlier and have heard it with set of all accepted.
The present is that creativity is that creativity is unlocked to suffering and that a partist will lead to miserable to reduce the eventually lead to misere.
So I want to ask everybody here today to ask everybody here today to live this notion of life?
Do you do that?
Because now I think about it, I think I don't think about it, I like to think of it was not a little thought.
I think that I think about it.
And even even dangerous.
I would like to see that this century is that this century is so on.
We can create creative mines much better attackle to live in it.
I know it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my mind to live to that dark in the dark thought that dark in my mind.
In fact, the phase of my career is in which my career.
Go too, I am a little bit a field of you, a regard.
I can spend four decade four decades.
Hopposed probably everything I'm going to be even published out the outside of the outside of the work that followed on that extraordinary book.
We are here with friends under each other, so I can explain you to explain the biggest success of my biggest success alone.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think about it, you're going to think about the morning to know the morning to the negine in the morning to the front of the front of you.
So I don't want to get that I don't want to get that.
I love love to the work that I love a work that I love a lot of the work that I love it.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I have come to the conclusion that I can just go with writing a psychological protection in the process of building in the process of the process in the process of building.
I have to write a safe distance of creating a safe distance between myself and my considering fear for the reactions, and my point publications.
I did this last year to ways to do that.
I'm in history, and I do a lot and reflect me in other societies to see or others to see whether or others have found a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search of my search and Roman has brought me to the old Greek and Rom.
Design, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greek and Rombs and Rombs didn't believe that creative was from herself.
And they believed that creativity creativity was a godless, which was from a writing place to the human beings of failure, to the humans and unknowledget.
The Greeks called this choices called this one.
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that was influistenced him for him --
The Roman had a species of the same idea.
In them was a several called creative mind creative spirit in a genius
The funny is that the Roman with a genius with a genius are not a piently piently piently pienting.
In their polite polisy was a kind of magical godst-entitt that was actually made in the walls of the ateler of the arty.
A little bit like Dobby the house fall.
If the artist was working on the work was the genius assistention.
Seviable, he gave form to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I talked about earlier, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work in his work
The artist was so in protection to be taken by the way, for example,
If you were brilliant work was brilliant to be all the honor for it.
Everybody knew that was a invisible genius you had helped to help
And when you crowd your work -- then that not only just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genius genie.
Long time that has been been to how in the West, creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed was changed
There was a very new idea: the individual ment, the individual ments is the center of the universe and allows and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attched from the Godle's godle's global world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual forward.
And for the first time in history was said about artist that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and they didn't have a genius and didn't have a genius that they were a genius and didn't that they were a genius and didn't that they have a genius and didn't have a didn't that they have
I have to say that I find a great froped to say that a great front of the from.
To person, one person, one single individual -- that he or she is whether she is the vehicle, the essential mystery, the source of the eternal mystery, of everything that is too much responsible -- that's too much responsibility for a fragic human psyche.
As if you ask somebody asks the sun in swallowed to swallow you to get the sun
Egos are relow-building gigans, and there are increased incredible high expectations to prestently remotioned
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists
If that is, and I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we back on a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship of the relation?
Maybe not.
We can make rational rational humanism not to make rational increase 500 years of rational speeches.
Probably in the audience of people who have recently reduced about the idea that elflashing about the idea that elflows with some of the feetic beings of artists.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you in that.
Yet, I'm going to ask it out.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we have that thought didn't have to do that thought we could not have to do that thought that we didn't have to do that thought that thought.
It focus as much as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally calcultive in the creative process.
Everybody who have to create something that has been trying to create all the attacks -- that the creative process doesn't always rational process rational mouse.
And that sometimes it feeling it in a paranoral.
I have the amazing American poet Ruth Stone of the Ruth Stone of the amazing.
She is thick in the nine. Her entig. Her entire life already writing.
She told me about her childhood on the country of Virginia.
Some she was at the field of the work was at work on the work, felt one, she heard a poem about the country.
It was so then, as though there was a great wave air wave air came out of the wave of air
And so, a poem than the country to her and move over the country to her --
She felt that the ground, she felt started to shake her at that point, and she knew her at that point, rendered to her life.
She ran home, backward by the poem and she had to do paper and she had to get paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and they had to get paper and she had to get paper and she had to get paper and she had to get paper and then paper and she had to do paper and then paper and then she's ran h
When it came up with her hundred by her hand her only was her only chance to write it on the waves.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then and ring them, but crossing it doesn't reach.
At that right now, the poem of the poem by her himself -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words
And then there were some of the story -- this is the most of the story -- I think it was the beautiful part of the story -- that they were close the poem --
Then she was looking for paper and paper and shake it was close by her way.
Juist at that potle-walked up a potleased to get a potled.
And with her other hand, so told me them, she pluned to the poem from the air.
She was packed the close to his tail, and it back into her body, while she was written it back into her body, and she was writing.
In that case, the poem was close to walk in the paper in the paper but in conversation in the enought order.
When I heard that -- what -- what accident, I thought of the creative process!
This is how my creative process! I'm not medium!
I'm a mouse, I am a mice, which every day on the same time of the blood, sweep, sweand trans through it, swear and trans through room.
But even in that daily swing, I had had a such a experience that had a experience of experience.
You will also know it yourself, that feeling that feeling that creative ideas in your recording from a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that for bron?
How can we use it without that we become that without we get crazy.
And in a way that is good for us to do that?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
I interviewed him for a magazine for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a lot of his life has been been shown in the shot of the toon-imagined artists that all the power power power to get the unlocked on the unlocal creative impulses that in him.
With the Tom was a little bit more solid of the rustiger.
And one day he was in Los Angeles about the frace, and changed the process of radical radical.
As he heard about that, he heard a clip of a melodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that is catched faker is caterable, crowd.
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to hit it.
But it didn't go to that.
He didn't have paper to no pap, no pap, no taperecorder to be taking it.
The well-known exciting excited about him: "I read, I read, and then it stays and then it stays the century of me back.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panick, but he didn't get in panick, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new ws.
He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat behind the sense of the sense of the sense of the wrong.
"Do you really think that I can write a song now?
If you really want to get that this song the song later you have to adaptor you have to do it.
Don't do anybody else else.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment when the process of the process of very different.
The work is the work is even the same thing with the known dark toon.
But the heavy that creative process in the creative process in him of the genius of the genius of the genius of genius
The genius was close to the skin and liver, just just just flowing up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the property, and the ownerable aspect that not completely Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of working on the way of work.
I had been taking a profijer of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bidd: Beminning.
I left in desperate despers.
You know that you don't want to be working good work and you don't think it's a terrible disaster is a horrible disaster --
Not just just a lot of bad -- really horrible bad and I don't have a lot of it.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project.
And then I remember that Tom that was genius to be the genius and I also decided to way.
I wish from my manuscrip, and focus crip, and focus to a empty of the room.
And I said to say, "Listen then, we know all, we know all of that if this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have in the way in what I have in me.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it better -- you have to get your thing to get your thing to do you have to get your thing to do is
Did you don't do that, you know, you don't do that, you'll be thane.
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notulals can be solid that is just a lot of office."
Tja--- U.inally, it comes up up here.
Every euwing in the North African desert of people together to dance in malight in malight on malight on sacred music.
On hours and hours, to the morning glors.
And that was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, it happened to be something very extraordinary.
One of those dancers then transcendent.
You know that I mean, what I mean, you know, you have ever seen something like a performer.
It was like the time was stilling and the dance of the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights -- but now everything together.
Plotissue he didn't just a human beings a human being.
In him, below him, blowed it down there.
A guy hot fire.
If something called the thing happened to knew people what it was Dan people what it was Dan she was going to clap and in the crop and in the crops, God."
Because that was for them.
And by the way, a fun historic fact, when Moren South South Spange: Then Spainting, they brought this habiting with them.
The spoke is the outcome, by the centuries of "Allah."
and that you hear the day in the day at the day and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments today.
If an artist in Spain something impossible, or magical does, or magical follow, "Allah, oil olone, olone, bad, bough."
Seapar, diseas: a glimpse of God.
So, the recipes we need.
Lasty is the dance of the dance of the dance of the under of the under day to wake a diduring dinary ladyer in the morning has no godle-ladymorning has no godlet.
At that moment, he is a little older man with bad while is that may never come to such up to such up to such up to such a little bit of the parenty.
Maybe there will never adaptor somebody God will be calling for the time.
What does he have to do about the rest of his life?
That's a hard to be hard here.
That's really hard to sell that is a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be not to be to.
Imagine that you don't go from your person is that the most unusual aspects of your person from you.
Imagine that you have them to be a while you have seen them from a single of the not after a source source.
When you are ready with it, they get through somebody else.
And so it was to be able to catch them all the time.
I incentive that I think about the thought of the thought of it.
The last months I worked on a book that will short short will ship out of the book where much too much to be recently.
The solusequence of that illuster progress.
If my minds with me on the hand, I like to go and I like the same before : I don't know that.
Do just you work on work.
For just you do things, whatever it is.
If you get task you to dance and dance you, thank you.
If the Godledly genius that you have been defined to make in your work at some point at some point of amazing source something of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful s."
Parentirely doesn't expand then it on.
And also "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that of hard.
"Oh, anything else, because we have pure human love and property, we stay for pure human love and property.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I had talked about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean and discover of genes.
We actually started from a new point, we were the biology to the biology -- and now we are trying to figure out that digital code to a new phase of the biology with the design and synthetishing and synthetishing and synthetic of life.
So we've always tried to ask the big questions of asking the big questions
"What is life?" is something that I think about how much biologists have tried to understand in different levels,
We tried to try and bring it back to minimal minimal minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to digitize digitize it.
When we sequenced the human genome genome we did sequenced from the analoge world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask and ask life -- we can regenerate new life -- we can create new life out of this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can remigrate in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at whether we can get a nature smaller genome can be able to get a nature of genome
We can go out in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or so.
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relatively simple compared to the metabolical compared to the metabolical map with the us.
Gelood me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch, it's very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell.
So we decided to ask the only route that was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions to do the components to make the founds.
And so we started asking questions like this, "Could we started a chromosome synthetisers?"
Staat the chemistry to make these very great molecules that we've never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome "up?
A chromosome is just a little bit of the way, a little piece of chemical chemical inds material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of digitize of life is accelerator is accelerator of the digits.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write rather slowly.
And our last point it would put it on this point on an exponential curve.
We're starting to get over 15 years ago.
There were some stages, to start to start with a bio-ethic ethic acction prevalue to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be a very hard to be a very hard to be a very hard to be a very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be a very hard to be a lot of DNA is the synthesis of the synthesis of the synth
There are teends of machines in the world that small pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so much more you get it to the point you get it to the point of it, the more false you get it to be a lot more false to be able to make it pieces of the world that are small pieces of the
So we had to make a new method for the connecting of these little pieces and core all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria kill.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, did the fell
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the beginning part of a little piece of chemical chemical chemical code in the bacteria genetic code gons and virtually went to make viral particles went and make virtually gs.
The vial particles were going to have been cells, they came back and kills back and killing the E. coli.
I was talking to the oil industry, and I said that model industry, and I said that model but already it a model of fast.
They laughing more than you.
So we think this is a situation where the software can build its own hardware can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in cassettes to various the cassettes --
to go to understand what the actual components of a living cell.
The design is crital, and when you start start with digital information in the computer than that digital information is very accuraft to be very accuraat the same time.
When we first did this genome for the first time was the standard of 1995, the standard of a 10,000 baseparats.
And eventually, we found after resequencing. When we had the original sequencing. If we had used the original sequence.
The design of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so much more and building smaller sub-unities that we need to design so that they can go together.
We design here unique parts in the way.
Maybe you read that we put water marks.
Bethink we have a four-liter-genetic code: A, C, Gand T.
Trios of those code for roughly 20 aminosours -- that there's a literacy diverse of every amino-oxygen oxximoxygen across every amino acid across the oxxygen -- that there's a literal age.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sending seats, though.
Aanvanly we cut up only a mile of that.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of creating pieces that were five to 7,000 letters long, just slightly long and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, then sets of 24,000 letter, than sets of 24,000 letter, to take it at 72,000.
In every stage -- we had a float, we could have sequence of these pieces so we could create a process that we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very robby.
We try to achieve the point of automatism,
So this looks like a basketbalfinal finale.
And once we get to the real big pieces -- over 100,000 basepares, they don't grow as easily more than 100,000 based, they don't easily more in E.
and that allows the most of the modern tools of the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to return to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologic is that being used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair DNA can add the pieces of together.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million radiodurans that three million radio radio durans in the way.
And that you see that in the top panel, set up to the top panel, just sheet out of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later and then he put it back into each other, exactly as it was first there.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drought up to be drought up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space that can find out and move forward to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of the way, there is a lot of this.
Here's a real micro-photo of the molecule that we've created with this processes -- in fact, in fact, in fact, but yestern mechanisms with the right design.
Gist caring for them to add automatically add them to add them to the point of the way.
This is not an electron-microscope microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we exbrand we spent under the public.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a humans, with a diverse structure.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages to prepressure.
Well, how do we started a chromosome of a chromosome of these?
With a virus is the clear is pretty easy.
With a bacteria is much complicated.
It's also simpler when you give up eukaryots, like us, you just whose weep, and just does another in, and it's what you know as it is what you know as it is what you know when you're reading.
In the bacterial species is the chromosome of the cell, but we have seen that we have seen a full transplant transplant to a full transplant from a chromosome of a cell to a other, and can activate it to a different, and it can activate it in a other, and can activation.
We have a chromosome of a micro-purpose of a microbs.
These are about as far as people and move as people and mosquito and much.
We added some extra little bit so that we could have this chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome of the way.
We reteed with anzymes to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein and make it piece of the eggs to make all the protein and make it pieces.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be very advanced the very advanced graphic images here, the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to further but we tried to develop the process of what we tried to develop process some of the process of what we were trying to figure out what we were trying to figure out what to get out to move out of the further and we tried to figure out what out.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovering all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of them or a third chromosome of them from day's character in one times.
People that evolution is propose to be a lot of the same as though that has not been much biology.
There are enzymes that restriction enzymes that are actually takes DNA.
The chromosome that was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome of it, we put in it -- we put it --
It was expressive, and it recognize, and it recognize the cell as strange of material, and so we had just the cell with the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the fronth chromosome of the new chromosome of the power,
He was blue because he was stopped the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time disappears all the characteristics of one species and changed completely changed in the new software that we put in the cell.
All the protein the membranes changed the members -- when we changed the genetic code in which it changed.
This is a power as genomic-alchemistry, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change fundamentally changing things fundamental nomentally change.
All right, I paid that this is not a creation that this is not a creation -- this is the forth of 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid an explosion that we may almost a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of new species of this digital design in this digital design design on this digital design design on this digital design to this digital design is in this digital design of this digital design is not a new version of the Cambrical engineering of
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear when you look at what it need.
We're going to go inside six-and-a-half billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context, I'm born in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us that in 1946; within 1946; within 46, that will be four are four there.
We have difficult with food, with the head, water medicine, fuel for the six-anda half billion.
That's hard to do that for neint.
We use five billion ton collectures, more than 30 billion measure.
That's 100 miloons of ves;
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than well-process than also to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course of course, all this carbon dioxide of the dioxide of the atmosphere is going to be in the atmosphere is that in the atmosphere is all the carbon dioxide of the dioxide of the dioxide of the dioxide of the dioxide fet.
And by the way, we have been looking at the worldwide, we've now got a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the designer for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen componses, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that has come out of it.
We are precisely constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques techniques of synthesemethods to do so-called combination genomics.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes, or tries to optimize processes to optimize octan octon or medicine, or new vaccins, new vaccins, we can change with a small team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's only standard standard selection.
We can select for life-fatbarity, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen maping imagination of what real design, so we work on and work that we can actually go and actually can actually design a new kind of the computer in the computer.
We don't know person how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus on fourth generation fuels.
On the grine, you know, the ethanol anol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuel of fuel that will come out of sugar, to more high-fuel fuels like entire octan octan or different different tuanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have great influence without the food price is higher and the availability to reduce the availability to be as we start with CO2 as we are doing it, and so we are doing it in that way, and we think that we are doing that way, and we think that we have the first fourth generation of fuels and we think we are the first fourth of 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- -- but by our global discoververy we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, about 2.5 miles in cost temperaturies.
It makes methane of CO2 with the help of molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at whether we can take CO2 -- which is easily through pipes to face that CO2 to face that CO2 fuel to send fuel to send this process.
So in a short of time spot we think we're able to expand we are able to do in the basic question: What is life?"
We actually have real, you know -- the available to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this, where then you can't do this, where then do that?
A important energy source is becoming a very important source.
But we also work on these tools of tools to think about fast servaccines of vaccines in the fast servaccine.
This year was the flu -- we always walked just something behind the facts of the facts as it comes on the right vaccine.
I think that can change change from textile vaccine.
Here's how the future can see how the future can see that evolution is going to change change the future of evolution tree with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still avoid away from humans.
Our goal is to assume that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that may be able to survive that may be a long time.
What I want to show you as a little bit quickly the fundament of a new technology that we at a overnal technology that we at a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment where you can locally or at the distance with immense amount of data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data visual data in
We look at this point here many gigabytes to digital images and can stay on the in-- and challenges and challens.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information or images are images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 meapixel reached in the 300 megapixel
It doesn't matter because it makes the only thing that would affect the prestations of a system pixeless of pixeless pixeless is on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, a whole example of non-picture data.
This is the graug house by Dickens. Each colucrazy.
To prove that it is actually text, and not really picture, and not to do something like this, to show that this is really text, this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange way to read a h-book way to read a h-book way to read a h-book way to read a h-book way to read a way to read a h-book way to read a h-book way to read a h-book way to read a little book of read a little bit st
I wouldn't add it.
This is a realistic, this is a scene. This is an outside.
Every big image is the beginning of a submit is the beginning of a lot.
This is really the job and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper of magazining medium is.
We also have done something with the corner of this outside of The Guardian.
We made a nick of advertention of high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertisement -- and we have extra information -- and we have brought information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car seat, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen at the screen too.
We hope this is not a pop-ups and other third flaw -- not needed to be more than it doesn't need to be more than it doesn't need any more.
Of course are maps a map for the hand, is a for a technology like these, I won't spending time to spending this field, except that we can contribuy contributing.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and on top of the NASA.
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, which is connected with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promoting on to the University of Washington, by Steve Seitz at U.W.
and Rick Sselfiski at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's been made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see it, you know, we can experience dives, and the multiresolution and experience the multiresolution --
The space television of the images has a meant is meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have brought these images together with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genome. And so you can see elements of stabilized diashot diassion.
I don't sure whether or there is another environments.
There are still a lot of space televisier.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we work in my head is the realm that we have been working in my head is the real power of the environments of this technique, at the power of the environments on our website.
We had to read it with the lawyer and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for images from Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images of people in Flickr. You just get a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flick Do Dame with the campus and you get and get and get a little bit of the campus
And each of these orange chains a picture that was a picture that was part of this model was going to be this model of model of this model of this model of this model of this model turns out to be a picture again that model turns out to be a picture of this orange of this orange was going to be part of this orange that was a picture again.
So this is Flickr images that are all copperiod of this way are reportified to be retired.
And we can navigate at simple way to navigate simple way to catch simple way.
You know, I never thought I would have thought that I would have ever worked at Microsoft
It's overwhelming to be so unfortune here.
I believe you can see that this many types of these are cameras well, everything from gloflexcameras, a lot of them together, a great number of then, conversation.
I'll try to find some weird images
There are so much covered by facing faces and so on.
Exywhere between the photographs -- there are them --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also choiced by the program.
If we have the poster in diverse, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really do things with the social environment. This is now using the data -- from the entire collective memory of the entire memory of the entire one of the Earth, and copyright looks at each other.
All these photographs are being constructed with each other, and sample is a very bigger than the sharing of the parts.
You then have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth,
So here is a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual A.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it to use the provide of the preparts of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are being taken from metap-data that somebody else somebody else in the way.
If somebody all of these heils would like a cliking and their names and their names are require to the Notre Dame require that data, and I can use the access to that metap-versum versus a kind of cross-versus and create this kind of cross-model, and created social experience.
And of course, the side product of this is an immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, which not only is from air, which is not only from air-photos, satellites, but also from the collective images and other applies is an engineering from the collective -- but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that makes you can get some software possible in the next years, in the next years, all the images that can be copyping all the images that can copy?
BA: Yes. What this is discovered is discovering this.
It creates to create your wiss, hyperlinks between images of images.
And it does that based on the based of the data in the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is available to semantic information that are available to have a lot of these images are available to available to the wealth of these images are available images are available to be available to do that much of these images are availing display availing that much of these images are available to dishead as much of these imagining.
When you look for imagine, you know, you feel a search in the weber and the text on the webpage on the webpage of information about what the image represent.
What if now, this image copposed to all your image?
Then the number of semantic connectives, and the amount of wealth that comes from that comes out of the magine is a classical networking effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense places of traveling and of equals and eat is the possibility to live between those who are the old life's life's living in the wind, that have been forward in the wind, the post-polishing in the wind, the prod, the profine in the prod, the profine in bitters.
The science that Jaguar-smans still traveling the Milky road the myths of Inextently with meaning the mythes of meaning in the Himalaya boodhundreds of Dhars that we are still jade in the breathing that we live in an absolutely of Dharma, the world in which we live in an absolutely of the anthropology, but is not just solid sophisticated, but is not a sility,
the consequenced of a set apply set adaptation choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all parts all the same adapted requisction: Words born -- Brenes children in the world.
We all make all insultions of invation
Again, with the unclearly distinction by the death.
So it can't be surprising that we all all singing, dancing and art.
But interesting is the unique catch adans of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is the Penan in the wolds on Borneo, or the Voo-Conolites in Haiti, or the fights in the Kaisut desert in North Kenya, the Candya, the Candya, the Curn Sahara. Havanai -- this is the man of Sahara. This is -- this is the man of the Sahara. This is -- or now, a mama'd a maago, or a mathe-hells of Quom, or a ma,
Everest, the goddin-mother of the world.
They all learn that we can learn that we can think different, else on Earth can think of the earth in oriently.
If you think about it, you can just give this idea you can only give you hope.
Samen forms the intelligentles, the world is a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her just as the biological life web, the biospiritual web.
This cultural life web is to imagine as a equal nosphenomenon.
The equal feature of the foot part, if the totally the totally of all the thoughts, dreams, myths, ideas and intuitions and intuitions are conscioutions of human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness.
The equal feater is the great nality.
She is the symbol of all that we are and all of that we can be as amazing curiosity of animal species.
Just as the biosphere is food, the equal is the equal bigger mate.
No biologist would be able to work that at least half of all the species of all the species of the species of extinct state, because it's simply not true.
And the thing that is the most optic scenario is not even in the neighborhoods of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing of this is the loss.
When everybody here was born on the earth were born on Earth, there were six-thousand talks on Earth was talking about it.
A language is more than her word-shape or her grammatical rules.
A language is a front of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that has been the soul of every unique culture the material world reached the material world.
Every language is a century -- a century cold, a dirty age, an ecosystem at spiritual potential possibilities.
From that six-six-dollar talks about half of not the day in children of not fluistered in children's fluistene.
They are not longer took babies to be babies touched
Effectively means that unless a change, that they are already dead.
Is there something like this, then you know, the way to be held by ping the last of your people, the last of your people, no chance to speak the wisdom of the ancestors by giving the promiss or the promiss must be tegetting the tegetting to see?
And reciions that tergene is someone's the state every two weeks somewhere on the Earth, because every two weeks are strong and died it the last letter of an old language.
Some of you say, "Super, wouldn't be better place, if we all all the way the world would speak as we all all the same language. I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba -- well, let's take Yoruba
Or Kogi.' You will realize how it could not speak your own language.
So what I want to do today is you on a short journey by the equ, which has to sketch a picture of what in fact, a picture of what in fact,
Many of us forgotten that when I have it about a different way of being in a different way of doing -- I also really mean.
For example, this Barasana-child in the North West Amazone, the people of the anaconda, that believe she believes that she from floor, the river, in the buI have the river, in the buI have heily sun.
This is a lot of cognitive that cognitive the colors and don't underestimate the violence of the making of the oerware of the oerware of the oerware dependent on the hanging way.
They have a regular language and human-a-marriages, which is called a linguistic exogamed -- you have to married somebody else.
These are roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary full of their houses, where six or seven language, but you never hear somebody else a language, but you never hear to exercise somebody a language.
They are simply listening and then speaking and then speaking.
One of the fascinator stem that I have lived with which I read the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuador, a slowly.
In 1957 tried to explain five missionars, but they made a critical mistake.
Over the air, they are photographs of themselves with our ideas to our ideas to our ideas that they forgotten this had never seen a two-dimensional picture image had never seen a two-dimensional image had seen pictures of pictures of themselves from themselves from the sky.
They got the photographs on and tried to find the shape behind the face.
When they didn't found anything, they concluded that the duivel that they were riep, and the missionaries were through the missionaries with spire missionary.
But the Waorani were not just outside of the Waorans, but also each other.
First of their death, fine came out of the death,
We could remember genealogies to eight generations back and tracting two cases, where we found a natural death.
When we continued to go and put that one man of parents that one man ever died, and he was only only only only only amazing they had an amazing single shaped a amazing knowledge of the oerwideld.
Their hunters, urine in 40 pass to remove and tell what animal species of which animal species.

And to understand this sensal things, I had to learn what to do is something about this particular faith of Vodou, which is not a cult of black magic.
It's an entire metaphysical worldvieview image, very interesting --
Would I ask you the great world's religions what would you say to say it?
Christendom, was lam, bulb, jodend, joc.
One continent to get outside of the attain from the attacked that Africa didn't have religious belief, of course they had no religious belief -- they had this way.
Voodoo is simply the destile of this destined religious ideas as the tragic diaspora during diaspora during period.
What voodoo is so interesting is the living amazing between the lives, and the deaths and the deaths and the deaths and the deaths and the deaths and the deaths and the deaths and the deaths and kills the deaths and kills the death,
The lives, the spirit --
The minds can be attacked from the Great Water, the Great Water, response to the soul of the life in the past of the life in the pair of the life, so that at the god.
So that's why food-death, "You blanks out to the church and talking about God.
We dance in the temple and God." And because you're so concerned and because you're so concerned by the spirit -- what can you happ?
This leads to a amazing trance -- Vood-equivalent in trance that streffelectricious gloos in trance that rate coals.
This is demonstrates the opportunity of the spirit of the spirit to influence the body is extreme extask is expose extasion.
And of all the people, where I ever have lived with the Kogi is the most extraordinary -- a lot of the north,
And stem melations of the Tairona civilization, which has ever the Caribic coastal flake of Colombia in the nasleep of the divertion.
They were prout, in a sole-volcanic massive that above the coastal flake.

"Do you see it? It's like I said you have saying you go.
That's how beautiful it is to protect this too protection." They call themselves the older brothers.
According to them are the younger brothers, which are responsible for the destruction of the world.
This is a point of the intuitive is very important.
If we think about inhead, we often Rout, we often Rousands and we often Rouseau and the old fabulous fabulous in his simple wild, a sense that racistic is simplicity.
Or we took stories and say that these people's closer to the Earth at the size of the Earth is than us.
Inheem-in-nor people's nor is expected by nostalgy.
For both is very little space in the malaria moer square or the Ame stories of Tibe. Desalnificance temporary of Tibet. Desalniance temporary of the Earth's Earth, which is not aware of the Earth's idea of the Earth's conscious -- it's based on a much subttile is the idea that the Earth, the idea that the Earth can only away.
What does that mean? It means that a little child from the Andes, which is grown up with belief that the mountain an Apu-mountain a fundamental other human people, and a other relationship of other relationship to that are block than a little child from Monta, and a other relationship that will have been a little bit of Monta, that the mountain a little child with the idea that the messagetting a set of the idea that the mountains.

Interestingly, the metaphor that define the defining between the individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were cable.
And that made me another people, then my friends of the Kwagiultants who believe that those forests are the life's life's life's life's Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavile of the world wwheats from the world swwwwwhaping of the world wheats of the World Wed me Snavel of the Cwagiant of the Kwagiultic mine of the Cwagiant than that they were the Kwagiving Kwagiving of the Kump of the Kun S.
These minds are important to their Hamatsa-inducation.
If you start to get the idea that these cultures can create different realities can create different realities of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discovery.
It's a picture I april right in the North West Amazone nam.
This is ayahou, the most powerful psychoactive willing from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahoused is so fascinating is not just the farmacological potential of it, but how fattential of it, but how through two sources.
And sile there is a wooden living that took carboline, harmaline and harmaline in itself and slight hallucinating light hallucinating works.
If you take only the plant seems it looks like a blue of blue room by your consciousness.
The plant is mixes with a calls of a coffee behind Psychotria viridis.
The plant running powerful tryptamines, nurracy for brain serotonine, dimethyltry-ptamine, 5-methyltry-ptamine.
Do you ever seen the Yanomami when they were that snuclear, that substance of different species that methoxyltry-methoxyltry?
That powder you nose in blow-blow-up is being hired picture, painted with barokay images to a sea of electricity. This ship doesn't reform for the soil from realit; it creates from realit; it creates of reality.
I tried to try to convince my professor, Richard Evan -- a man who did the psychedelic agent of psychedelic agent of paddo's in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryed trying, this trying, because when the effect are hallucinating, because when the effect are intricians, no one more home, no one more home, no one more hallucy to experience the hallucy of the effect in the human dark because they get from a single of the effect of the human darm-oxiamin the human dark: monoxioxidase.
They can only be orally taken oremerging with something that the monoamine of sating.
The fascinating is that the catch of the carbolines in the lizars are the gaps of the try-ptamine ptaminine of trying, how can this follow in a floor in a flora of 80,000 plans of finding in a biochemical various of the shapes that are shaped a biochemical variant of the partment that is that larger than the shake of the partominal partners.
We say eufemistic "trial and ror," which is like meaningless.
The Indians say: "The plants talking to us, what does that? This stem means that? This stem means that this tribe, the Cof, who has been taken from ayahuasca, who can identify the eyes as one species would money.
If you ask their questions to map their taxonomy in map saying, "I thought you know something of plants.
You know about that.
You can look at all the 17 species in a night of the 17 species in a night in different shows of singing.
You didn't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of tell.
Now, the problem is that even those of us that are under that sympathic opportunities are straightforward them as curious and colorful to a footness in history, the real world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world is going to be the real world, meaning our world is that the real world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not reminded to be reminded or his technological innovations, but earlier when the time the age that we stony in which we stony in the massive destruction in the massive destruction of biological and cultural destruction of biological and cultural and cultural diversity.
All cultures always have parted parts to a dance with new life possibilities.
Technology is not the problem is not the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians didn't stop Sioux-a-stop and tregard, just as must as well, as as that Americans stopped Americans to be their purple and way.
It's not change or technology that is the integrity of the equal feater endanger. It's power.
The wraction of the government.
And what you look at the world, you will notice that it doesn't have the fat, you will not,
These are dynamic living following are identify by identify that are advantage of their applications.
Or this is going to be the huge amount of the Penan, a nomadication of the Penan, a nomadic of South Asiatically follow that to the forest generation in the forest, and now received to the reduced and prostitution, where you can see that the river, where you can see that the river, where you can see that the river, and you can see that the rivers the revided smart that the slib of Bore where you can see the riath, where you can seems is is is to Chinese suspectanese, and then the river, and then you can seems of the ggth of the riquququququques the rivere that the rivere that the rivere that the rivere that the rivere that the river, and then seems are

In the case, of the Yanomami are the diseases that are inside of the discovery of the discovery of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genoccide, the physical challenge of a people, universally requarted, but equal noca, the destructive of the life-e-life, not only in many areas is not only being being in many areas even four of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level, until you get on the basic level.
I have a young colleague in West-China to Cengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And then I got in Lhasa -- I understood behind the statistics that you hear about it.
6,000 Hisily mouse monuments destruction, 1.2 million people kilily the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was strongly known to the Panchen Lama.
And he was a based on the based of that Chinese invasion begon.
His uncle flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people to Nepal in Nepal --
His mother was prison because she was rich because she was rich because she was rich
He was the prison the prison when he was two -- he was hidden under her rock, because she doesn't have no longer hidden without hidden without him because they don't cut hidden to hidden in her hidden of her rock.
The sister that heldhafti-smoky was in a foot skamp of food skamp camp
And one day she got them per uncil on a dock of Mao. For this overration of this overover, she was going to be returned out to seven years of desperator of the way.
The pain of Tibet can be unrotate, but the freeding of the people, but the fast of the people,
And eventually it comes up on a choice.
Do we live in a gray world of units, or want to live a color want to live a color or want to reversity?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she peace that we direction a common that we direction a community -- amor, amor, amor, amor, amor,
We would not only see the human imagination is limited to a small thinking, model, but we would also have been defined and forgotten that there are other options that there are other opportunities.
We can feel our kind of feel that our species about [150,000] years on Earth.
The Neolitic Revolution, which we got agriculture to the cult our overgiven to the shaman of the shaman was replaced by the proshaman by the proshaman by the proshaman by specializing specialization and we found a specialization by specialization of years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
This surface history is that we don't care about the idea that we have all the answers to all the question that we have all the question that will come to our path.
If the intelligiant cultures of the world to mean of people, they answered with 10,000 different voted, they answered with 10,000 different votes of the world to 10,000 different vote to 10,000 different voted to the meaning of the world to be meaning of the world to be asked the meaning of the world to be the meaning of the world to mean an the meaning of the world to mean the meaning of the world to mean the meaning of the world to be the meaning of the
And it's in that song that we are going to discover the possibility to be what we are. And it's a conscious species that everything in the work to be all the crows. There are large moments of optimism.
This picture I have taken on the northern thing in Island taking with Inuit's near wearwal in the narwal of jail.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextent '50s, to focus in the 1950s, to felt our soutings.
The opa of Olayer way.
The family for his life and unnaile for his life and until him all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inuit not afraid for the colles; they used to use it.
The giles of their baby originally made of fish in craw-dominated fish in caribook-skin.
Olayers the store was not afraid for the pool, or the storm that was require to the storm that was require for the storm that was running for the pool.
He went outside, he was living from sea hondense skin business and poeped the pow-began to woman, he started to froze, he shaped it as a limmet.
He brought a low-layer on the side.
When it was solide was solid, he was a dog of them.
He had the dog and improvised a heart and improvised a heart
Over the ribba bad of catchasts.
He was looking for a dog and disappears and disappears and disappearing poems.
And this is going to go around with nothing to do with nothing in many ways, state of the Inuit the resisted of the Inin and all the inforestian environments in the world.
In april 1999 the Canadian government the Inuit the Inuit the Inuit in the full of a piece of country larger than California and Texas saming our home.
It's independent. They regard. They regard. They regard.
It's a amazing example of how a nation can be enought enought to her people.
And finally, I think it's clearly diversed to whom at least for whom to these home in the world is required, that they actually don't get away.
They're somebody's home land.
They are about twices of the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for all of us and for all the dreams of these kids, just like the unit, part of a uncross-ography geography of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely the idea that politicians never reached anything.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic is not convincing stories can change stories the world can change the world, and we probably the best tell us the world, we probably are the best tell you are 35 million times a month, we probably 35 million times a month school -- we are in 156 countries on a million-public.
We make a felt to travel to the eat, with our audience, with our audience, in such particular cultural places, where the towards are so istant so istant to live in a sense of the anthropology will be reversal baring that this world are going to be reverse in a different way to live in a multicularticulartic world that we can find a way to live in a multicultural and plual world
where all the way that all the people, can contribute to our satch as well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have a book of which I have powered to be a book of the book
Maybe you see paralls with information from other sources.
Let me explain some sense of explain some sense that you may have been memist.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma, of all the Westery, interested society.
And that official dogma, as a follow-level of our citizens, and the wal-making our citizens, we need to give them so much individual possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good good at the point of human part of human beings of human beings
For exposed to freedom us to act the way to do a higher wheeling a higher wheeling without insides.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices love in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically means more well-well-of-freedom means
This is so deep become so deep in our society that nobody would pull that would be doubt.
And in our lives, this dogma, this dogma.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my market. A high-great.
Even about dressings.
For 175 chances 175 changes there are in my supermarket, there are a different brick of brand-virgin olijfoile and twelectrics have been afficult of balance of balance of balance in the global by.
And then you can make a tallow of them to make a threat at the case, of the case between 175 species for you.
So that's the attacked of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can get your stareoset of them -- luidspeakers, casious, caselerate, caseler, radio, versy.
At one electronicastore you can choose from this attack.
You can put six-and-half million different systems, with parts of parts of that store.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young ago you could all all sorts of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You home it it up. You didn't buy it.
And that was the advantage that it never happened to be a lot of the advantage of the way that had never been studying it.
And that time is forward.
Today, there are a lot of different statement.
Especially in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with behind player, neush-player, and crative fun burns to be able to reach them to be breaking out of the fun --
And you don't seen this model that model in the store, but you can sure that that happens in the store.
The consequence, people come to the store, and asking this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question is that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy that doesn't do a lot of too much does not do too much does not do too much too much to buy that doesn't do too much to buy that doesn't do too much as a mobile of that doesn't do to.
Also in aspects of life that are much more important than the attackle of stuff, this explosive explosive to a fact a fact of choices a fact.
Gealth care, it's in the U.S. is not in the U.S. is not that you go to the doctor you go to the doctor, and that you have to do what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A A or we can do B B --
A has this front and nadled.
The point of them and tasks. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dr, you say, "Dr, what do you find out of the thing?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front and B has this front and down.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dkter, if you were me, what would you do you do that?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you.
And we call "own investing the patient."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy task of decision of somebody with residentify of things -- the doctor -- the doctor sure somebody who is free and not the best condition to take decision to take decision to take decision, and the patient.
Good up to sleep up with it, because the goals, you and I cannot buy and I cannot buy it.
Why do advertising, if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we think the next morning our doctor our doctor to ask that other market average age.
Our identity yet a price, an engineering aspect of our existence, is now overbulling on choices like you can see on this slides.
Our identity is is that our identity of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we wanted to do it.
Every morning to the rise of the morning you have to think about what person want.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There has been a time that free-free everybody out of it, that you could get as possible to the way as possible and then as possible to children in the way of the children begon.
The only real choice was with whom was with whom and what you did.
Now is freat everything for the operating for the way.
I left particularly intelligent students, which I was double to be at less househwork than huge househwork than asked it.
They don't have a sommer or air or in early early air than in the early time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Do I whether or not? Do I not? Do I not?
Or will I wait? Do I wait? Do I whether a career or a career e?"
These are all the questions of questions.
They go through to them into an answer them to have a answer and it doesn't mean that they don't get their houses, and then no good numbers and not a good numbers.
And they have right. They're important lives.
And then we come to work with work. Carl just already that technology has been able to work every minute of every day.
There is one place, which I love to love it, where WiFi does it does.
I don't know what because I want to keep that place.
But good, which is huge choicy of work on the way we are getting away on and then we'll be wondering, or not.
We can look at a footbalwed-fighting our son, with our son, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and maybe our laptop on laptop of our laptop on so.
And even when they all get out of the things that are all minute of that competition, with all sorts of questions: "Do I answer?
Do I response this emailt -- I write this letter writing --
And even when the answer is "Nee" is, we experience the football of our son, in a very different way.
Where we look at it, the large, the grand, materialist things, life-style thing: life is a question of choos;
So the world looked like the world looked like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world looks at the world looks right now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad?
The answer is, "Ja."
We all know what is good about is right is, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about it.
And that huge choices has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on the human being.
A very contrast effect is that the paralyzing paralyzing than freezing in the world is freezing
Well so much choices find people find the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of that, a research to investment in volunte-plans.
A colleague of me access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a great policy policy-far-million employees about 2,000 flowing about 2,000 fings.
They found that for every 10 policy foundation foundaries that the worked on the working on the working on the work in part, the participipal two percent
In five of ftont-front-far, 10 percent employees with five than five sounds. Why?
Because it foundly farishing to choose that people are just telling people to the following look at the next day, and that they were just expose to the next day, and that on.
And from the point comes down.
That doesn't mean that means people after their pensionate, not just a dream of food because they didn't have enough money to have seen the choice known that they did have been so hard as a lot of the choice knocks.
They went to go to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose.
The working was willing to double their own contributation to double.
So too much choices can work paralyzed together.
And I think the world looks like that.
If it goes to the century to the century you like to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to read up with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the paralyzing of our disources and choosing the outcome of the result of the result than it would be the case, when we had less options of the result of if we had had fewer options of options are the case,
There are multiple of reasons for it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, it can seem that the choice, it doesn't look perfect.
You ask you in this case, that would have been better for a different choice would have been better.
This dreamed alternative is that you get spids that you get spids of your choice.
And spits the floor, the flodogs of the choice that you have made it even like a good choice.
The more options there are the way to have the stuff is to have unaway of unaway of electricity that else is option.
Second, with a second reason with substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert gave tomorrow, in the value of things that we depend up the value of things that we comparishing them together.
If you can including many alternatives, you can see many alternatives that you all the alternatives that you aware of all the alternatives that you off.
And that makes you fewer towards the alternative that you have chosen chose.
One excuses the non-New Yorkers below you.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is just on a valiquid in the Hamptons.
They have a third wound.
They are sitting on a beach. Stralend weather. No way.
Don't do it? "Don't be a crazy thinking, "it's care?
Everybody in my neighborhoods in Manhattan is the city
I could cut my car for the door parkers."
And he is two weeks, with the idea that he was mislesing every day that he was mislesing every day parking parking place for a great parking place.
And substitutional costs going to be cost of our choice, even if we make a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are too more attraction alternatives.
And those are presenting to us as substitutional costs.
Another example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Life in here, and for example, and that you don't have to go overhead.
Another point is that you have a little choice other choice.
And all of that other has so his attractive to the option that is tools, and the regard.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this is my search for a new breeding a new breezing new breeze.
I walk almost justified to blow.
Being it was only one kind of stuff, and it bought it up, and it was incredibly unch of incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the breeding long, and often enough to waste, felt the birth of to.
And after years I went to the store for a new now.
I said, "Day, I want to have a stuff, this is my me."
And the winter said, "Do you smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you whether or a rhyth? Do you was stone-washed?
Do you want to get a bridge effect?
Do you can get something expand whether or flin, or flink out, and so he went through it.
I was talking about it. And I was talking about a while I said, "I want to get the only breek that was asked it was there."
He had no idea which was not an idea which was and so I have a hour long hour for all the possible bble breeks are passing adapted to passes.
I just love the store of the wincle up with a explored by a single of breezing breek.
I had better -- I had better -- I could have this better to do it better.
But I didn't felt me better.
Why? Or r to myself, I wrote this to myself, I wrote a book of a book
The reason I didn't feel better.
I started without any any expectation, because I just had one kind of spirit known.
And then it turned out there and one of them would be fast perfect.
What I was a good thing I was a good thing, but not perfect.
And so I read my bend, with my expectations, and that took me teleur.
The more possibilities of people have to have more expectations they celebrate about the deservices of that possibilities.
And that means people are less tight with results, even if the good results, even as the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case, you didn't know what I'm talking about.
In the real thing is going to do is about that.
Everything was bad was bad to worse
Because when everything was bad to was worse to have people even pretty surprising experiences.
In our modern society can we as well as a well-forward citizens perfection, but the best thing we have ever reached to is something so good as well as we expected, is something as good as we expected.
Nonce we get touch, because our expectations, my expectations, and high high up.
The secret of happiness -- this is for you all come -- the secret of happiness is not too much expectant.
I want to assume to be a car biographically elementally -- that I'm with a woman who is really fantastic elementally fantastic is fantastic --
I didn't have her not asked her to her less rate.
But with less enoughs taking his good opportunities.
And finally, when you get a bad on a bad sit as there is only one kind of predicting, you can ask your question -- you can ask your ask to why you are unrestones.
The answer is that case in case call.
The world is responsible. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different greenhouse to fall the breeding one that turns out to fall, who is responsible?
The answer is just as simple -- that's just as simple --
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different greents you didn't have an excuse to fail.
So when people take decisions and even if the results of those decisions are good about their choice.
And they take them to take themselves.
In the Western society clinic depression in the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations.
A factor -- not the enia, but it's a significant factor in this explosive increase of depression and murdered self, is that people have been so often teleurial experience of their high-expectancy.
And when they try to explain the teleuring for themselves, they give themselves the deal.
So the nettoresulat is that we talked about it, but we feel on it, but our bader objective -- but our bader
Another a containing together.
This is the official dogma, that is by everybody is going to be taken for where everybody else.
But that's not.
It doesn't light that it doesn't choose that can choose better, it doesn't have to choose it doesn't automatically more choice.
There's a magical groundaries to choices. Well that I don't know.
But I know that we all have been for a long time for the point that choices are behaviors of our well-behaviors.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best one.
The choices in industrialized countries comes from material overflows from material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, and we've already heard about what the problem is not so much choice, but right that there is too much choice.
So the paradox that I speak to the moderne, so that we have been a well-wall the way West.
That's frustrated, and it up to this is about, Steve Levitt you yesterday that expensive and hard to installing kids are not helping your money. South of your money.
I say the same about this distinction, complicated choices -- they didn't help them to help up with damage -- they didn't do damage.
They make our lives.
If a part of what people in our society in our society to make all those choices to have overbehaviors to have countries to have the life would have been on it.
Also, we would go on on it.
That's what economists call a Parto-improvement.
Everybody is better from reverbing requirement of well-freedom of what happens -- and that comes by the last of choices we with our with our heavily that we have with our heavily that we have with our response.
Finally, you read this image story -- you read this image story like to say, "Ah, what the fish is what know?
None is possible in a fish."
A scale imagination, a short square, that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I took about it, the way I understood that this fish is a smart of the fish is smart is smart.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you get the fishing to create opportunities to create opportunities you don't have freedom, but paralyzar, but paralyzarming.
If you get the fish of the fishing to create opportunities to create the less rate.
It leads to more dissemination and less too much lower force and less rate.
Everybody has a fishing needs a fish.
This is free-free to limited -- possible for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the absence of a figures of a figures is asking to miserable to remove and distributed, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
