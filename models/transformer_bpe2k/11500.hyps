And I was showing these two dia's slides to show that the past three million years to show the last three million years of the last three million years of the vast three million years of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States.
But this is the scree of this particular problem because it doesn't have the didded of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice skap on the North Pol is in the clopping heart of our global climate system.
It's called in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slides I show is a version of what happened the last 25 years is happened to the last 25 years is happened.
The permanently is touched in the room.
As you see, it out of dark blue.
That's the year, the major aily away the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The solid permanent, five years or older, five years older, is almost like blood, that's from the body sicks.
In 25 years is the way from this to this one.
And that's a problem because the floors around the North Ictually warmp and there is a very big amount of woman inal amount of woman is becoming a very big amount of woman is is going to be awed by micror is in mething,
And the opportunity to the totaly amount of the atmospher, that could be explore to the amount of the atmospher, if we considered it to surprising the engaged to surprising the engaged to defree the entire amount of the atmospheres --
In some of the ondiep, in Alaska borreleass of the water.
And last winter Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another ondiep to another ondiep to a different team to a different ondiep meer.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is going to be that will be going to be able to be that will be going to be that.
A reason is that this huge of this huge called Greenland from the north-warming warms.
This is a smell twater river.
The watererrors to greater than anything.
This is the Kangerlussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea espeal of the sea because it turns out because it is the place where the place the place where the sea to sea to sea
These stroming these fluence.
And the other side of the planet on the South Pole, becomes the largest ice mass the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the last months rapped scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice gative ice balance.
More specific is the icequipal of the South Pole, very quickly to the square very quickly watereilanother.
The whole continent to six meters in sea espiece of seeing the way Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the one after two after two after two after two after two years ago, which is now a couple years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is helping his drinwater of his drink water.
In the Andes, this glester is the source of drinking this city.
There are now more stroms.
But when they disappears it also drink water.
In California was a devices of 40 percent in the snovel of the Sierra.
It comes to the waterrors of the waterreservices.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions are going to be there.
This global dry to a behaviolal stize a behaviolence.
And the number of course, the number of course is support with an unbelievable and never seen seen in the world.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unfortunately.
If you look at the right of a historic context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 degrees to CO2 every 24 hours every 24 hours --
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Kook at the eye area of the Stille of the Stilles, from America, and to every single sile from the Indian subcontinent, there is a stic dalization of the ocean an in the ocean in the ocean ans.
The only big cause of the opportunity of the earth, which is the destraight of the early of the phot of fossil fueling fossil fueling fossil fueless.
Olie is a problem, and stepped the whole largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding together.
And there was a present to build a lot more city-cools to build more city.
But we see a engage of a engaged.
These are the supported carbon which the bultions of the bomen's annutinctivativves, and where green alternativves,
There's a political streedomer to the gang in our country.

We find that the scale is -- and it still still likely it still still likely
So, you don't make your carried about climate change.
Let me just show us on the way to us.

So let's take a look at this hypermodern scone of these hyper-coale.
Fantastic. The machines make very very much of lavil.
But that's the sound of scone of scone carbon technology.

Thank you.
And I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I refer back to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I'm going to deep notice that there is not waren: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever entreately 27 miles in enombic.
It has to engaged the engaged to be less than a billions of less than a billions of second after the universe was started to 600 million times a second of 600 million times a second to 600 million times a second to 600 million times a second at the engaged to 600 million times a second to be the engaged to the environment,
Enorm ambitius, dus!
This is the machine under Geneves.
We took photographs of that less in detectors in detectors in detectors that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in ath the scale so that you can see the scale can see the scale can see the scale can see the scale.
At 10, we put the machine for the first ones to the first ones for the first one.
This photo became by ATLAS.
That caused to a facest in the controllling in the controllling amer.
It's a picture of the first particles of the first particles that all around the LHC gone, and with a set up with a piece of the LHC, by particles in the detector in the detector in the detector of the detect of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw this picture on 10 September that the machine works, we knew that the machine is a huge government.
I don't know if this is the largest across the largest across the Google and saw that the Internet page page page of business.
That means we have a kind of cultural as a scientific impact impact impact impact impact that means we have made a cultural as a a scientific impact that means we have made a cultural as a scientific impact a cultural as a single of the kind of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden behaviors.
And those behaviors ago, 13 thousand camples when the machine on full forces.
The engineers will say, "No o o small be.
They can do because they are superidend his very lower temperaturies.
So, on min 271 degrees, colderder, couder, which can be behaviors that behaviors that behavior.
In one of the connection between the negaps in the LHC, sat a constructive in the LHC, a constructive old
And then the wirels was something warmer, and there was intended to be electrical weather electrical campyers.
This was the result.
This is still inpresent if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons of the magnets more than 20 ton the 30 inches of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets ton the magnets ton the magnets ton the magnets ton the magne
We had about 50 monmongnets.
We had to do them out of stories, what we did it.
We all have eparenty.
Now they're back to wear back again.
Eind map the LHC will be intacks.
We will be able to expect it and we expect to expect and we can go to expect with the building of the building of the universe are building the building of the universe are building the universe are building the building of the universe are going to be expectations of the universe are going to be expectations of the universe are going to be expectations of the universe.
Now, of course, that is an incidentify incidents the value of scientific research. It's easily to work.
I think it's the fact that it's so hard to be so hard to be more than the true of things like the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientistate Humphrey Davy, I think of the truth, I think of the values of the values of his living his life's living his life's Michael Faray, "No something so dangerous for the progress of human mind to needs our imagineering to needs to take our imagineering science that we are not a mystersterize that there are not a new mysteriouslice, and the world that are not going to be new new new new world in the world that there are not going to be not going to be not going to be not not not not not not not not not not not not going to have to have to have to neattist in the new imaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimagination in the world that
Thank you.
I would like to start with you start to ask to you go to your children at your children at your childhood at your blocks.
When you discovered how you had to do it, they were pull and well, you know, was actually sold to learn to the entire considering and hanging hanging space and hanging hanging space relations.
Rut, Ruilian insight is strong with the world to understand the world to understand us.
If an informatic, inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with objects and my farmer, Jeeding Calanii -- what we would ask me to ask me -- what we would use a computer to ask me -- what we would use a computer that enter moves on a digital finger to a plate individuate individual with the inevity to a ply individual confy to the inevention with the introffy ine, with with with with with with the introducation of information of information of the introformatice, which is to introductions of the inspire of the iny the inspify iny inst introductions of the ney the ney the ney the ney
and we can ordering to order?
These question of us so beyond the answer to find an answer to find an answer the building Siftables.
Cort together is a Siftable to be an interactive computer on a cooking.
They can be able to the dog with the doctor, they can feel detect detect and they fattect a short and they followed a short and they can feel the purposed to the hand they can feel the follows, and they can feel become a screen with the hand they fattace to be able to the hand and they fatttackage, they can feel each other.
The nuclear practice is the physical handely, as blocks like blocks can be replaced by the graph to graduate it.
And the follows are Siftables a new ecosystem for the ways of digital informatize digital informatize digital informatial informatize the way.
And then this helping these high differently, are more physical different, and even from their movement, and even from the way we are moving to discover and other new and other kinds of interactions, there are different new and interactions.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instituted to tell a video to tell you to care playing by the changing and others played by the others played to playful.
These interactive portravities are consciousness.
Indians are picture, they will be able to each each other.
If they are ringly, they are going to be able to be single this and can be single single it can be single this and can be single this and can be single this and can be single this and can be single this and can be single this and can be so.
For they feel movement and dogging.
We realized algaw that one of the interesting getting one of these interaction, the use of these interaction, the use of interaction, as it was a lost of color as it was a louse of a color as it was a louse of a color as it was a louse of the interesting of the interactional game.
In this example of three Siftables care three Siftables to go to a color in a very long to go to a color in a very long to go to a color in a very long to go to a color in a very example,
If we have the threat, we go.
There are some of crapid of education for the education of language -- mathematics with language, mathematics that we want to give people to be the possibility to see the result of the immediately extinctic incentives.
Here is touch a Fibonacces of a Fibonacces by a simple reknowledge programmate.
Here we show a game is a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle, you get in every single around a will, and you get a lot of the Siftle, and sensed the words are controlling in a dictionary.
After 30 seconds is the very recorded to be very shud, and differently a new series of possibilities of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to make it out in the Media video of it.
They were really really away from that.
And one of the most interesting things of these approaching is that people don't need instructions to have instructions needs to have instructions of these approach.
All of you have to say "Most word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people on the tests.
That's our botta tester, rightening the ones of the one-enter-one.
And it looks like the Siftables well.
For him this was just blocks.
Here is an interactive paintiny towards towards towards toially
We wanted to learn a platform for the language of language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrated.
He can bring new carracters in the scene of the Siftable with that Caracter of the table to the table.
Here he shows the sun one.
Video: The sun comes up up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene area of tracking.
Video: The orange tractor.
God thought. Yeah! Yeah!
And by Siftables and the needle and the needle can be able places to do the characters with each each each each each each each each each each each each -- Video: Worl too.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a open end of an open fine.
and he decided how it destraping.
Video: The cat air.
DM: The last example I will show you today will show you a synthesizer and live music strument that we have developed recent a sound producing a sound producing produces and pressure present to the lead, bass and pressure pressuming and pressure present the ones and pressure pressed to show
Eengineer, in fact, in which you can see what you want to use which you want to use which you want to use what you want.
These sounds can be injected in the age of Siftables so that you can certain the patterns itself in the patterns of these patterns are injected in the patterns of the patterns can certain the patterns in the patterns of the patterns can be the patterns that
You pick a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the attacks of a living protect effects like reverb and filter.
They're going to be a sound and attacked by the opportunity.
For the alizes like tempo and volume that are the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a first pattern.
Now, I place the basice.
Video: Now, DM: Now I'm feeing what slagwork
Video: DM: And now I buy the filter on the filter of the press of the pressure of the presson to the effect of the presson to the pressure of the filter of the presses, so I can be able to the presses, so I can be able to the press, so I can be able to the presses, so I can be able
Video: I can get it very quickly about the opportunity of the tempo blokice.
Video: Now, DM: Now I'm copy the filter on the bas for what expression.
Video: I can do it pattern the pattern as it playt.
So, I don't have to plann, but I can't improvise everything to plann, the longer and shorter as I want to do it.
And in the end end of the dimms of the volume of the volume Siftable to left the left of the volume.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from to the new people, my passion of new people, which are better interfaces that are better interfaces in the brain and bodies work.
And today I had the time to show you one new election in this design area of election in this design building in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this only the attace is to a very new generation of helping in the interacts of digital media to our world as we want to do it.
I thank you to do it.
I look at it out to you with you all to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you all of it.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My living a long life is to be able to do not think that ever will change that ever changes.
And yet, there is an invest in my life and career in my life and career in my own relationship with my work on my work on my work on my work on my work on the work on my work on my work to see in my work on the work of the join.
It started a book, I had a book that I have written written a memoire: "Ext," which is in the opposite to my first time in the entire world and an international exist.
The sequences is that people now to be told me to be told me as if I do do it.
Which is the way -- med?
People come to me and questions, "Ben you don't know that that you can't be able to be able to evenar?
Do you don't afraid you will be able to be writing in the whole life will never be a book in the world will be going to be a book in the warm of the people will be going to be going to be written in the entire life will be going to be writing for warm write to be written written written written you will be a book you w
Do you don't know about that.
And the thing that is you know you know.
Of course, that would be very much. But I remember that I remember 20 years ago, I was a tiener, I was told that I wanted to be writer to be writing.
People said, "Do you don't get succes?
Do you don't afford to be able to entire to such on such a this?
Do you don't afraid your life to this work is going to be able to this work is something from the puin of your buildings in your buildings in your buildings with your buildings with your bitter's falone?"
Ie’s in those streting.
In the short comes to this questions on this questions on this is "Yeah.
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that are enough that are enough must be enough.
All of the time already of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things band, you don't want to know true.
For example, and other ones and other engineering things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time when the last time you know, the last time to come from.
Is it ration?
Is it the logical that somebody is air to be a job for the work for their human being?
What is so particular to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the effects of the effects of the other spectivate working.
Take my father. He was scaled to be engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that he worked on him in the 40 years that he didn't worked in the 40 years or he didn't know that it was not afraid to be a job for it.
And so of course, "John, how is it with your chemist?"
No, no, there was not about it.
To fair be: score engineers have been crapidly engineers with the century of the century of the century of the manician alcoholistitualcoholists to be able to be able to be able to be the century to be able to be able to be able to be a
Scheat, which have a kind of reputation.
Not only writers also writers have other creative people have to be the reputation of human beings to be instable.
And you look at the grim of the grim of the most magnife creative gests of the 20th century.
Many stierves young by own own across own across own across own it.
And even those who don't have a self-moord places to be under their gave to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be under their gaves to be under their gave places to be able to be able to be such a melerror.
In the last interview for his death, Norman Mailer: "Meat every of my books is a piece of mistakes is a piece of message of myself --
That's a pretty thing to say about your life.
But of this kind of extincluding this kind of extincluding it.
We all heard the first ones and have heard it with all the time and accepted it with all the time.
The hemissing mind is that creativity is unloctistate unlost of list and that a artistious stone-involved to cell.
So I want to ask everyone here today to ask with that idea of life?
Do you do that?
Because I'm going to talk about it, I think about it, I don't think it's not a pretty good daught for it.
I think it is the weather extend.
And also even though you see.
I don't like to see this century this century also so good.
We can creative gests to be more than to live in the way to live in the time.
I know it for me, in my situation, in my situation, without dangerous to that dark to those dark in the dark of the dark in the dark of the dark in my situation,
Seker is the fase in which my career now.
Go took me again, I'm still young years.
I can do another four decades to work on the decades.
And the thing probably will be everything I'm still going to be still in the outside world as the work that is the work that extraordinary successful book successful book successful book.
We're here with friends under the ones of the ones of the ones of the ones probably slightly solid to be a biggest success.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think about it, you know, I'm going to you, you know the morning to the derank for the third to the derank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me of love to the work I love the work I love the work of the work I love to the work of the work that I love to work of the work that I love me of the work that I love me of the work I love me.
The question is, "Human?"
After for a long time I am to the conclusion of the conclusion that I can just go to write a psychological protection in the process in the process iness.
I have to create the writing of a securious distance of mistrunning to create the reactional angst of the reactions, and my survival publications.
I had seen the last year, and I seen it to do that.
I am in history and I do do deep me in other day's harvent to see or somehow to see or others to be a better way to help people to help to help people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search of my search of the old Greeks and Romens.
Let me just it's a long and including story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Rombultions and Rombon-people don't creativity of them,
Men belief-believity was a goddarable place, which was a destraintable place, unknowledge and unknowledge of the human reasons.
The Greeks called these Greeks called these involved in creativity "demon."
And Socrates beliefed that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that whed him in the way that he had influist.
The Romenends had a spectable idea.
And if you have to get a considered creative memory a "genii."
The grappy is that the Rombs with a geniian to be a genion.
In their policy was a geniian equipal entities that extended in the walls of the artistate of the artist.
A little like Dobby the house of the house follow.
If the artistate at the work was the geniassistance.
And the fact he shape to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the destate that I had the first one, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work work.
The artistic became so in protection to be a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant was not going to be a little eat.
Everybody knew that a unvisible geniious geniiious geniile.
Where's the work on your work -- you know, not just about yourself.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty ones you had.
Lange time is that had been described how in the Wests creativity was described
When the Renaissance, and everything changed changed.
And there is a very new idea: the individual human engine: the individual point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical weather extension,
That was the beginning of the rational house to the beginning of the rational house
People believity that creativity of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual
And for the first time in history there was about artiststs about artiststs that they were a geniiize a genion.
I have to say that I think a big follow.
To one person one person one one, one person on that he or she or she or she or she or she whether it's the sourcell of the century mystery, of everything godnment, creative and the knowledge for a much of a responsibility for a fragic human psycha.
Also, if you ask the sun in the sun in the sun of sun.
Egos are building up to gigantic provide and there are unprestations and there are implant expectations of prestations in prestations of prestations in expectations of expectations of expectations of expectations of expectations of expectations of expectations of expectations of the improvementally expectations of expectations of expectations and expectally unature of prestations and become expectations of the imprestat
And I think this press the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists of artists has made a lot of artists of artists of artists has made a lot of artists of artists.
If that's so on, and I think is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this differently?
Can we go back to a old beginning to a old relationship between the ments and creative mysterious mysterii?
Maybe not.
And we can make 500 years of rational, we can't make 500 years in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of rational.
And probably the thing is in the audiences in the audiences of scientific divided to the idea that elphysics with some evidence of factors with some eighting inspiring high-textacking high-tes.
It doesn't seem to me that I'm going to get you all that will get to get you in that.
And I walk to ask me death.
Why isn't it?
Why don't we would we do do that thought isn't to the next one?
It is just so much as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally explority that are including including the creative process.
Everybody who has to create something to create -- so in fact, so in fact, all the attacks -- you know, the creative process is not always rationally rationally rationally done rational.
And that sometimes almost paranorally attention.
I have an amazing the great American animal American Ruth Stone degree.
And they're closer in the negentic of the nearly writing them already already written
She told me about her youth in the plattelevil and of Virginia.
Sometimes if she was on the following on the work was a pull of the one, about the country.
It was so so if there was a big golf air came to rolll.
And so it was closed golfing over the country to her across her across her.
And she feeling the ground under her food, and he knew that time to do her at that moment but one thing to do to do that in the time to do for her life.
And they ran than house behind by the gedid, and they had to get so quickly, and paper see paper and paper to paper and paper to packs.
When it was the closed by her hold her hold her hunt was that her only chance to write it on the one.
Sometimes she didn't quickly enough.
And then then ring and ring it but calls it doesn't get home.
And in this is a little moments the poem of her him, on the many of the fields, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another solid -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in one of the sown.
And I was going to be able to -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the closed of the story -- that they were the did.
And then she was looking at house in house and paper, and paper, and shed it by her himself by her himself by her himself in the him and paper.
Juist at that moment she had a potased to paking.
And with her other hand, so told me me so, she was the poeming of the air.
And she paked it to his state and it back back in her body, and it back back in her body, while she shreef.
And in those cases came up to the paper that in the sense of paper in the paper in the entire gord.
When I think about -- I thought -- what I would like to be a creative process my creative process to create proces!
So this is how my creative process not! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth mous, which every day on the same time stip on the same time stiping and transformed with blood, and transformed up with blood.
But even in that daily swhed a experience of experience.
You will also be able to know it itself to know that sense that sense of creative ideas in your exborrelationships, and you can identify impossible.
What is that then is that for letter?
How can we use it without that we are bee?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musiciance Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazzero.
We had this government about this.
Tom is a big part of his life is the tounimage of his life the tounimage of the considered artists that from all the monkey of all the months that are trying to get the inconsible creative impulsable creative impultimate impulate the impull that example,
And the ''d Tom what rustiginer.
And one day he read in Los Angeles of the speed radical radical radical radical radical.
And as he heard there was so well, he heard a fragmentally of a melodie.
The decided to him, as inspiration that does does inspiration that does crope, ccrope, ccrope.
It was a beautiful melodied and he wanted to fashones.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper touch, no pen, no tape, no touch, no touch, no touch, no tape, no touch, no touch, no touch, no touch, no tape, no tape, no tper
The well-exciting exciting up again, "I got the melotic crazy and then stay the ecentury behind me evice.
I'm not well. I can't do it.
He didn't worked in panice, but he stop the whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and he says, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the stud?"
"Do you really write that I can write a song?
If you want this songe, you have to get later, you have to do later, if I have time for you have to do that.
And not, not, not, somebody else falls.
Go neighbors at Leonard Coh." And from that time in lose the process of the process of election to be very others.
The work itself is the same thing with the final dark subject.
But the six, the supplant that creative process in him him expensive to the geniious destrained of geniiize the geniiion.
The geniian to the house on the house and livered only but election.
Tom realized that there was no reason there was to go to the engaged by going.
It could also be a wonderful bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the propertent aspect that not really really really about Tom itself in itself.
That story has changed my way of work.
I have.
I was at middle in the writing process of Ets, Biddle --
And in a given moment I explore in well.
You know that well, you want to be good good and you think it is a terrible ramp of the ones of the book booking.
Not summerly bad and really terrible bad bad bad bad bad one.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project
And then I remember Tom who who are who who who was going to be a powered to be a power.
I wish I wish from my manuscrips and direct me to a very much of the room.
And I said, "Lister dope thing, we know everyboth is not just to be able to be able to be able to be able to me.
You can see that I think I have to do everything I have in me.
More I can't care I don't care
If you find it better better than you have to be better than you have to do it.
Sttook you don't do it, you'd not you, you'll be thrope.
I just write because that's not not a little work.
Oh, and in the notile and magine month, which is just a differentling today just a differently."
Tja--- Uitself the right right here
Euwen ago, there were in the North African wood African ams together to dancure in major to dancing the sillage music
Uren and hours and hours, to the morning gglors.
That was always great, because the dancers were fulling professionals.
But sometimes very sometimes happened to be something for it happens to be something for summers.
One of those dance became transcendent.
You're going to know what I mean, you ever ever ever see, you know, you ever see something in a performer.
It was like the time was stillisted and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of night, but now now everything else together.
And the pulling isn't longer just a human beings to be a human.
In him of him on him him of him head.
A godnment solid him.
If you destike something happened to be people what it was Dan an inside to claps: "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Al
Because it was for it.
By the way, a fun historic fact, and the Moren Spanish Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu -- they were to do this one.
The extent is echecher by the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah."
That is to your hear today at the day at today and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments.
If a artists in Spanish or magic, or magically, it ropt, "Allah, oh, oah, all all the way to do it, Allah, great, Allah, big."
Our understandar: a glimp of God.
Precions we needed to be what we needed to do.
Lastig is the thanks the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the flowing 11 hours to the following 11 hours don't have godnment.
And at that moment he is a little parently, and a bad guy who will never be able to such a lot of high high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-highly high
Maybe there will never be someone else to be someone else of the dances.
What does it now now he still have to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell crap for a creative mind.
But so painful to be not to be to be not to be to be there.
Imagine you don't know about the most unuses of your person from your your person from your your person from yourself.
Imagine you believe that you believe them a time you have a time to be a time to specifically letter.
When you class on there are reading on somebody else on someone else.
And so it describes, everything.
I just hang inevent that thought of day.
The last months I worked on a book, which will be differently, the books, and the book where many of a long time to be a lot of a lot of it.
The opportunity of that illuster progress precise excell.
And if my mind with me to the hall, I love me to be the same before before you know, you don't know the same before that.
Doo just you work.
Blive you do, which it is.
If you do it to thank you to thank you.
If the goddle-genius is to be decided to be decided to be able to do something from the wonderful sourcing the wonderful sources, "Ole!"
Geventually not, thank you but it goes.
And also "Olen!"
I believe that I believe that I believe that.
"Olen!"How much because we can get from pure human song of human song-wood-rather than plumessage of the way to be plure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, righ!
You know, I had this for a couple of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genome.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology to the digital isers, and now we try to go from those digital code to a new physics to design in biology and synthesis of the digital of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think about a lot of biolos have tried to understand in different levels in different levels of biolos in different levels of biolos.
We tried to do different approach, it back to less imum imale components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitalize.
When we have the human genome of the human genome of the analoge world of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask the question: we can create regeneral, or we can create new life from this digital universe of digital universe of digital universe of digital universe of digital universe?
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genome, in a laboratory in a laboratory of himself in a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of a tiny of a tiny organized italium in a
And we tried to look at or we have tried to a nature genome can come to a nature of genome can come to be a nature of the one.
We can be in the order of hundred genes of the 500 or somewhere there are there.
But if we look at the metabolic, that's relatively relatively considered with the one.
Geloof me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at a piece of shape, it's very unliving cell this would be a living cell to be a living cell of the genes that would be a living cell of the genes that would be a very unliving cell to be a very unliving cell would be a living cell of the genes that would be a
We decided to do that the only route of the only route to synthetise to synthetise to synthetise the components to be a couple of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started a chromosopm synthetisers?"
Sometimes the chemistry it to make these very big molecules that we never have before.
And if we do that, if we can do that, we can do a chromosh "eat the chromosquito
A chromosh is the way, but a piece of chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitize of the digital is exponential evidence.
Our ability to write the genetic code lose of nons, but is a these, but is a thesis is although to be enomen.
And our last point it would put in this moment in an exponential curve.
We're going to start with 15 years ago.
There were some city of city for negotic ethical ethical ethic ethical access to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be a synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis of
There are tiends thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length of teength process, so longer you make it piece of the ones are more following you make more following the more.
So, we had to make a new method for the tiny of these little pieces of these little pieces of all the follows.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small frus that bacteria box that bacteria death.
We designed the stuff -- the outcorrections --
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the backward to chemical chemical stone in the bacteria -- and the bacteria genetic code genetic code of genetic particles are going to make a tape of these particles are going to make a chemical particles and virtually make it incentions in the bacteria --
The virtual particles were going to local cells, they came back to the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was unfortune in speak with the oil industry, and I said that model that model to be a good quickly well.
They laught more than yourself
And so we think this is a situation is a situation that the software can build his own hears in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much greater to be a lot of greater griculture.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromospher.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettttles, so we could cassetttta setttta settta
to understand what the invitious components of a living cell cell cell cell cell
The design is critical critic, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information are very accure.
When we first first to the first time this genome in 1995, the standard exactly a packed in 1995,000 basement.
And finally we found the resequence, we were 30 followed the warror sequence, it was not in the wars of the ward to start to starting to start to start to start to start to start to starting to start to start to start to start to be able to be the war.
And the design is the design of study is the design of study that 50 letters are going to be surfaces to all the other pieces of 50 letters to build the other pieces of building to build together to build together to design so that they can go.
We design design unital parts of the invitial parts of the invent of the invitial parts in the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the invital parts.
Maybe you might have a watermarks.
Bedit: we have a four-letter-code: A, C, C, Good: A, Go and T.
Trios of those letters code for run away from 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple attace to each aminoxygen
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words,
And we just just just to do it only mickly just to do it.
Some of them were teleurged that there are no followed that there are no dies.
We have these pieces of these pieces of these pieces of things.
There are enzymes that they reparently and together.
And we started to make pieces of these stuck pieces of these five to 7,000 letters long-7,000 letters long-food, and you have a pieces of 24,000 letter, to 724,000 letter, to 7240.
In every city of the city of these stuck pieces so we could care sequences to create them because we could create a process that will be very robuying to be very very robly -- you see straight -- you see straight to see sequence.
We try to achieve the point of automatiseration
So this looks like a basketbalfinal finale.
So dra dra we come to the real big pieces -- more than 100,000 basegs -- they don't get easy more in E.
That explains the extincluding all modern tools of the molecular biology.
That's why we went to to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination is used by the biology to reparently the biology to reparently the biology to reparentment, which can feel out of the biology to feet together
Here is an example of it.
There's a organized called Deinoccus radio radio durans that three million radiation to be three million radiation to be three million radiation to be three million radiation to the radiation of the radiation of the radiation of the radiation of the radiation of the radiation of the radio durance of the radiation of the organ.
And you see in the top paneel, she's a chromosophim crazy from each other.
12 ot 24 hours later, he was going to go back in the other, exactly like the first one,
There are thousands of organizes that are.
These organisms can be dried up to be very extincludes.
They can live in a vacuuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can be able to exist, that can prove to move to be a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been trust to be a lot of it,
Here is a very extincluding the molecule that we have made with this processes -- fact with this processes -- fact with the right design of the studying design of the studying in the studying them in the stuck of the studying in the studge.
But, it is to add automatically together.
This is not an electronen-microscope photo; this is a wirelectron-photograph.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope can see it.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audience, we were exactly exactly so.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by humans, with a duce structure.
The molecule is more than 300 million.
If we would be able to press the 10-points letter, without spations, then there is 142 page of genetic code to press the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with a 10-pointing points to press the genetic code the printints.
Good, how do we started, how do we started to do it? How do we go?
And with a fours is the clearly notable.
And with a bacteria is a lot of including a lot of includes.
It's also simpler if you give eukile eukaryots, as well, you know, you know the celkern from the celkern and dot is what you know if it is the clones.
And in the bacteria is the chromospher, but we have integrated in the cell of a chromosh that we can see a full transpline to a chromospling a chromosphere to a differentation of a cell to a other, and it can extend to a differentation and the activity of a chromosophim in the cell of a ch
We have a chromosh of a chromosh of a microcks.
These are about so far from each other and mices.
We feed what extra genes so we could sell this chromospher.
We have the contemed with enzymes to make all egals.
It was woman was a sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be the very avanced images here can be a new chromosome, the new chromosome, the new chromosome.
We even thought he would come to sover the process of it would come to develop the process to develop the process of what extend to develop the process of it.
This is an essentially evolutional evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromospher, or a third of third in the way from days, with thousands of inside one time to the species.
People who are evolution as if there are not going to have a lot of biology not have a lot of biology in the biology of biology
There are enzymes that restrictive enzymes are enough that are really enough DNA exters.
The chromospheric that in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromospher.
It became express the other chromospher, and the other chromospher, and the other chromospher, and we had finally finally finally the cell with the new chromoses.
He was blue law from the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time extensive all the characteristics of one species, and changed in the new software in the new software that we had stopped in the cell software in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the ene,
All of the egged to change the genetic code -- when we changed the genetic code was exactly in which it was changed.
This is a mag than a genomicial alchemist, but we are in the software in the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
Good, I paying a little bit of the Camount of this is not a scaling -- this is preborn on 3.5 billion evolution, and I paid paying a new species of Cambrary explosion of the Cambrane new species of Cambig, which is based on this digital design in this digital design design to this digital design design in this digital design design in this digital design in a lot of the Cambig,
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's pretty much as you look at what you see is what there is needing.
We're going to inside of the six-en-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in 19466.
There are three people on this planet;
for each of us who are in 1946; within 19466; within 40 years.
We have to food, with the food, with the free of scales water, medicine, medicine, medicine, medicine.
That's lasting to do that for nex.
We use five billion tons of collapsed in 30 billion vices.
That's 100 miloons of fattacks per day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whether or what process is to replace; then it is a huge challenge of challenge
And then of course, of course that carbon dioxide of the stone that in the atmosphere to the atmosphere.
And as all of our worldwell, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dog different components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is come from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the electronicaindustry that is from the diversity that is from the animpactonentions of the electronentions that we
We are preservices by a biological reality and our example.
We don't have techniques techniques to do very quickly synthesemethods to do so called combinati-genomics to do that.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes of the circles to optimalizing octon to produce or medicine or medicine, new vaccins, we can change with a small team of molecular biology than the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for life-living vatbulbly production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen image of what real design design is to work on the world, so you can really go to the gang and a new kind of computer in computer and a new kind of computer can design in computer in computer of the computer of what the real design of what the real design of what the real design imagination of what the real design of what we can design on the computer of what the real design of what real real design and a new kind of what we can design in the computer of what real design and a new kind of what real design of what real real design species we can design to design to work,
We don't know what it will see is going to see it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of their genetic code of disease.
We fourth fourth of us now fourth generation of fuel
And our slives you free to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come from the engage of sugars will come to more high and more high and more more and different kinds of nearly entano.
But the only way we think that biology big influence of biology big influence in the food-influence, and we start to laying the first of CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food, and why we are facing cells that way to do it in that way to do it, and we think we can do the first fourth to have the first generation and influence.
And sonlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwomellow explore of the discoverovered of the methods.
This is an organized that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles in the deep, in cow-too, in cow-temperaturies.
It makes methane of CO2 with the celebrate water state waterstal as energy bron.
We're looking at the way we can take CO2 CO2 to be easily to four pipipipes to fabrief, which is to brand to brand to brandstome, to be this process to stop this process to stop this process to stop this process to stop this process to stop this process to sturban introduc
So, in a short time we think we are able to be able to break out of the basic question: "What is life?"
We have working, you know, the protect describes the petrochemical industrial industry industry of it.
Yeah. You can't do this at TED to do where then what?
A important energy source of energy broads.
But we also work on these workle to use these workle to think about fastful servicices.
This year there was the gricultural -- we always always always just just a little behind the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change from textation by the textile of the vaccines of texting.
Here you see how the future can see the future can be changing the evolutiontion, the destate of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and finally eukaryota.
We are still far away from humans of humans.
Our goal is sure we make a chance to do a chance to survive to survival enough to do that well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you if first to show you is the fundament, the fundament, to a new technology that we can get to Microsoft to be a year ago.
And it's a environment in you local or in you can get immense to immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at here many gigabies to digital images and can be here nature in the way in in-- and except to be inside -- and the sortor and the sorts to our wish and the sorts to our wish and the sorts of the ws.
And it doesn't matter how many information, how big information, how big these collections or images or imagine these collections or images or imagine of information.
Most of these are normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library or Congress and sit in the 300 megapixel of the 300 megapixel of the 300 megapixel
It all doesn't matter because the only thing because the only thing that would be able to be able to influence, the amount of pixels on the screen on the screen on the screen.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a completely book, a example of non-image data.
This is the graduate house by Dickens. Elich collabor is a cheap.
To prove that it really really really textly, and no imagination, we can do something something that is not going to show that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a very strange of terrible to read a e-book.
I wouldn't do it to be able to it.
This is a realistic, this is an example. This is an example.
Every big image image is the beginning of a subdeal.
This is really gives you the place the place of a real paper of a real paper of a real paper or well-well-scale memore.
We also have done something with the corner of these exactly gave from The Guardian.
We have a nep adversation of high-resolution -- many higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information of information in information
If you want to see the possibilities of these auto see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to make the limb the limitations of hands of hands from the screen in the screen to do the screen to do the screen
We open this is not going to be more means and other third more means and other third -- not newspase.
Of course are agricultural for the dog of the dog for a technology as thing, I'm not going to spending a time to spentire to spend a lot of except to be a lot of a lot of exactly in the front of the ones of the around.
These are all the weather in the U.S.
And then put on the top of the NASA
Let's look at something else looks.
This is the way, this is now in the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, which two techniques two techniques together.
A erris Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful study of computer-vision research research of Washington, a is moso on Washington, aaway from Washington, aago on University on University on University on University of Washington and the other thing about University of Wore is at University of the University of the University of the University in
and Rick Sselfiski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's measured by Seadragon.
When we do, we do this -- we see by the images and the multi-resolution resolution experiences of experiences.
The space scike, the space of the images has this meaning.
The computer vision of vision algorithmese, so that they are over, so that they are overcome the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- which they are electioned in the Canaholes, and all these things that are space and all these things are space.
I don't know if there is another time is, other environments to show you.
There are still a lot of space that are still a lot of space.
I want to show one of Noah's warringly sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynthesis of Photosynthesis that we have worked in my head is the communicate of these summer, the reality of these environment, in the environments to look at our website.
We had to know about the advocates of advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look at Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flicks.
And each of these orange chirs a imagination to be a imagination that turned out to be part of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of model that turns are part of this model of this orange of this model of this orange of this orange of this orange that are part of this orange of this orange that orange of this orange in the image of the model that turturns out to be a picture.
And so are all this Flickr imagines, which are copied in this way space in this way in this way.
And we can do in simple evidence to nature touches in the way to follow them to too.
Weu, I had never thought I would have ever thought I would have ever work.
It's survival here is so devices to be so device.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are so much of gsm to spirirous city to spire the couple of them in this environment.
I'll try to find what strange images to find some strange of the images of that.
There are so many works by face and thirquicks.
And now, in this is even a series of photographs --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is choiced by the program.
If we are, we care the poster in a physician image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do really things with the social environment, this is now the data of everyone -- from the entitive ged in the fact, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, and buck it looks like to each other.
All these photographs are a very little bit of a very little bigger than the square of the partment.
You have a model that from the whole Earth,
So this as a destate at Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Arine.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it in complexity of the people who are used to the people who use it.
Their own photographs are going to be someone else invoiding someone else inved.
If somebody would want to climb and their tunkes and their took invote to the Notre Dame exactly roughs to be a crazy that can use metape to space, which is metape to space, and created a access of any photographs, and created a kind of cross and created a kind of cro-mental experiencevent social experienced social experiencraise and sappeace of the Notre of these kind of cross of cketttttttttttttttttttap
And of course, it's be-product this imments of this imments of any interesting place in every interesting place, which is not only from the air, which is not only from the air photos, satellite images and other applies is to collective images and other across the collective engineering in collective engineering from the collections of the collections of any interesting photographotos, which is not just from the collections of the collections of the collections of the interinterinteractions, but also of course of of course of course, is is is is is is is is is is of the collections of the collections of the collections of the collec
Our telling degree to thank you.
Chris Anderson: Heb I started to understand that what you know, the software possible, in the next years, all the images that are deed, all the images that are deed, by everyone in the world can buy together in the world can buy together in the world together in the world together in the next years,
BAA: Yeah. What this is discovering is discovering
It create, to your wishs, hyperlinks between imaginations.
And it does that basic basic of the data in the imaginations.
And that's going to be exciting when you think about the richching semantic information that many of these imaimagination that many of these imaginations.
When you go to the web for images, you feel a search for images and the textor on the webbpage page page of information about what the imagination is the image weather than the image weather you see a sequence.
What if you copied imagination is to be able to imagination?
And then the number of subling's number of subjects and the amount of rich rich is that from that comes from that is gigantic networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefeliciand.

I want to talk about some of you about some question of what I have to ask unfortunately.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other brones.
And I also try to explain some destroping you which has mist.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma air deattacks like followest the well-magest level of our citizens in the highest levels of them so much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much possible.
Freedom is a big good, an essentially part of the human exist.
And the freedom of the freedom to treat the way to do to work a higher which is a higher which is a higher of inment,
The ultimate freedom we find in choicice.
More choices like people in that people are more freedoing.
And more freedom means automatically more well.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be able to explain the society.
And in our life is this dogma is too four.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about threat.
Narly that 175 changed to be in my supermarkets in my supermarkets in my supermarkets in my supermarkets in the engineering of bas amicos have been a battacks.
And then you can make your task to make your own threats to the case that 175 species for yourself in the case,
So that's the attacked from my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can be able to stop themselves, cassions -- luck cassetttespeler, radio destrong garars.
And in that one electronics you can care of this attacking,
You can do it single six-half million different systems, with parts of those wine.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communications.
When I was young was a long time you could all all the partnerror, but only at Ma Bell.
You hours it to the access.
That was the prevent of the prevent that it never stuck up the way it never go.
And that time is present time is present the time is present time.
Tegently, there are very much different across the way to do that.
And in cell phones is the diversity imments.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the average -- which is the average -- that are takes in the cator and crack brace brought to be able to be able to be a fun fun to the fun --
And the way you don't see this model you don't see this model in the winke, but you can see, you can see, but you can see, you can see that happens happened.
The follow: people come to the winke, and stells these question.
And you know how the answer to that question on that question.
No one.
It's not possible, a possible, you know, it's not to buy that do not to be a lot of do.
And in aspects of the life that are more important than the attackcil of stuff is this explosive tomory of choices a fact.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. it's not inaverage to the doctors that you have to the doctors you have to do what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do do or we can do do to do to do it.
Another this predictouches and tunates.
But, and took this precevices. What do you want to do it?"
And you say, "Dokter, what it is find find it?"
And the doctor, "Art this predicting, and took this predicting, and tunates.
What do you want to do you want to do it?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you could do me, what would you do you do it?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you told you."
And we call "own inviti."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, which means the sware of the decisions of business to someone with a condition of business, somebody who has been sure to a free condition and not the best condition to take conditions -- the patient. For recipatient.
Good described slavate that nowhere it is nowhere, because the goely, you can't buy it.
Why do we don't do it, if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we think the next morning, our doctors to ask the question to ask that other market to ask that other market to ask that other market the other major to ask the next morning.
Our identy, yet a ingree-principle aspect of us existing choices like you can see on this dia.
Our identity is losing our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we just want to do but we want to do but I want to do it.
Everybody ocheat the opstate of the surface of what for person you want to be want.
Let's talk about the house is the shape.
There is a time that freedomatically everybody there was going to be able to be able to the way to be possible, and then then then possible, and then then possible.
The only workly choice was with well, not when and what you deservice.
Now freets of everything for the opportunity.
I eventually read to intelligent students, which I was at at least less house work on less house worse.
They are not dommer or or living in earlier than in earlier.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Do I don't trust whether now?
Or will I wait? Nmo, I first first children, or a career or a career or a career re?"
These are all the questions.
They are going to have to have a answer to have to be able to be able to get their houses.
And they are important.
And then we come to work. Carl global that technology to work on the state to work every minute every minute every minute every minute to work in the Randolph Hoteltelligency
There's one place a place place that I love secret me like the WiFi the got.
I don't walk to walk because I want to keep place.
But good, which is huge choices of work in that we are still going to be able to ask us to be true, or we are going to work or we go.
We can look at a footbalaxy of our sone, with us cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and which is our laptop of our laptop of the other side,
And even if they all come from the straight of those who are all the minute of those who ask: "Spectane: "Spectally I think of this phone, "Salthough I think of the answer think?
Do I like this emailtine reager?
And even if the answer is the answer is, we experience the footbalwood of our son a very different way.
Where we also look at the grout, the small, the small, lifestyl: life is a chose of choices of choices of choices of choices.
So the world there was going to be exactly extincluding the world
There were a choices, but not everything was a choices of choices.
And so the world looks like the world now.
The question is now: Is this well?
The answer is: "Yeah.
We all know what is good about is good to talk about what is bad is bad to it.
And that huge choices has two effects two effects on the ments.
A very extincluding the first thing is that the first ones than become more than beequipment.
And so many choices of choicicians find the laster to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example, a research of investments in freet,
A colleague of me crather access to investment data of Vanguard, a big policy progress of Vanguary, a big million worknearly nearded about 2,000 vestings.
They discovered that for every times, that for every times, which is the worked on the works, the particular percent desides of the works.
And if you care foundations deeth, there are less working with five percent of less work?
Because it to fields to field, so laster is so laster to choose that people are choice to the next day, and that surface that people like to the next day, and so forth.
And from extincluding the destate comes from the death.
That doesn't just mean that people after their pensive to eat their pensive to eat because they don't have enough money because they have not enough money to have been so lasted it was a choice as a choice of part for a disheppeace for a scale for a lot of the works.
And then they were walking to 5,000 dollars a year on their neus to go to their neus to go to their neus
The worked about the workly was to reach their own behavior.
To many choices can be lose example,
And I think the world there is that the world by so from that.
If it to go to the century the century, you want to do very much like to do the right choice choice, right?
You don't want to be explained with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the lost of us and cooking us and cooking less testate less to the result than it would be less to the result as we had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had to be less to
There are measurement, and for the ones to feel
A there, one of course there is a choice, for example, behind the choice of the choice of the choice was not perfect.
You assume to be in a case for another choice for another choice would be behind to be better than a case for a case for a case for a case of choice for that another choice for a case for a different choice for a case that would be better better choice better than a case for a case in a case.
This is dried alternative alternative to you get to get your choice.
And spike it is doing the following of the choice of the choice that you have made you have made a good choice.
How more options are going to be easier to be able to have the spired of unair of unair that election of the geods.
A second reason has to substitutions of doing substitutional costs.
And then Gilbert gave morning, the value of the value of things that we dependent to do with the things that we are consimilarly extincluding the things that we are dependent to do with the value of the things that are often to do the value of things that are often the value of the things that we are dependent to do with the things with the
If you can intend to intenthing, you can see many alternatives, you also see the alternativves, you can do it.
That makes your less touches to the alternative that you have cost that you have costs to be costs that you have coat.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit the streck of this example.
This is on the Hamptons.
They have a third wone.
They are a wonderful strand. Stralend weaer. Go ments in face.
Beter can not? "Don't be the carry," thinks that man, "it's authoriginal --
Everybody in my neighbors in Manhattan is the city extincluding on the city
I would be my car, my care."
And he so, the idea that he was two weeks, with the idea that he again the idea that he again a great parking place.
And the substitutions are going to cost of the entire we have, even if we have a wonderful choice, even if we make a wonderful choice.
How more possibilities are the opportunity to be more accessive alternatives.
And those presentation of us as substitutions like substitutional costs.
Another example.
This imagination is the imagination of a number of points.
Life in the right right right now, and you don't have to do things not have to survive things not have to go.
Another point is that you with any choice other choice extincluding other choices.
And all of the other has been so deattracking, which the coods are less involved options.
Ten third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in this time, my square to a new bouch of breedom.
I turn almost always play to be playing birth of them
Fger there was just one kind of play -- and that coat the past. The past totally won't cator comfortable, but if you know, the book long, but if you have enough enough to be enough to be enough to be enough it in the wheeld well.
And after the winkle for a newly for a newly neight.
I said, "Day, I want to get a spirit -- this is my mad."
And the wink-said, "Wilt you smart to you smart easy fit or relaxed a relaxed of relaxed w?
Do you buy butttons or a rit?
Do you have a bire with decision effect?
Wilt you something extend to pipe, or flink on pipipell of pipipesside.
I was sprakely played to be a time said "I want to say, "I want to be the only book that there was asked to the only one."
He had no idea which was no idea which was that was a hours of the moird of the moird of the moird to passion.
And so of course, I really, really, the winkle finally finally finally the winking,
I had done the better influence that possibilities I could do better better than that.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Om this to myself, I have a book this book.
The reason I don't feel better feeling me with all of these choice, I was starting to expect of a good speaking.
I started without the only expectation because I just just just one kind of playing one kind of playing.
And then it turned out there there are different wars, and one of there,
And what I cost was good, but not perfect.
And so I require, I reach my expectations, and that powered me teleur.
How more possibilities people have to expect more expectations they kill about the deserves of that possibilities of that possibilities of that possibilities of that possibilities of possibilities of people who are cooperions of the abilities of people have to expectations of people have
And that means people less testing his results are more than the good results are more as the good results.
Marketings don't know this isn't know?
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about that.
In the real thing is about it.
All it was better when everything was working.
Because when everything was working on the bad people could have a little bit of experiences have been going to have a lot of experiences.
In our modern society as a various citizens as a various citizens of perfections, but the best we can ever reach, is something very good as we had expected to be something as we had expected to be a very good as we had expect to be a very good as well.
No one of the rast, because our expectations, because our expectations, are expectaneously high.
The secret of happiness -- this for birds -- the secret is not to expect of happiness is not to expect of happiness.
I want to do here -- a car biographics -- I was a carried to be a woman who is really fantastic fantastic is really fantastic is really fantastic election.
I don't have a less tested with less tested me with less tested me with less tircle.
But with less enough to be good opportunities to be good opportunity.
And so so if you get a bad of a bad at the spirit is like there is a kind of precise and one kind of pre-in-strange you ask to ask why you inted.
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds of these are available to fall, who is turns out to vall, who is is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple. That's just so simple.
You had a better choice.
Meat hundreds of different bones to fales.
So, if people decided to make decisions are good as the results of those decisions are good eurged to their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the western society clinical depression under the boyer generations of the younger generations of the younger generature in the younger generations of the boardy.
A factor -- not the one one, but a significant factor in this explosive too explosive to this exploit is that people have to have been so often teleuring experiences have been in the high experiences are of their high expectations of their high expectation of the expectation of the immediately explosive
And if they then that teleuring for themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettory is that we set it is that we set up to prevent objective us feel in the bad of it.
Another a collabor.
This is the official dogma, which is by everyone for where is becoming ate.
But that's not the thing is not it.
It doesn't do a two-foot that can choose better than not cooking better than it doesn't have a car couldn't be automatically more choice that more choice is more choice that more choice is more choice to be better better than it still still
There's a magical groundaries of choicices.
But I know we are all long, the point of the point that choices are very expensive us which are more expension.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost class -- a principle, which we can keep the best thing to keep the best thing to do we can keep the best thing to do we can keep the best thing to do we can keep the best to do the best thing --
The choices in industrialized countries comes from material to the material survival flowed from material flow.
There are many places on the world, we heard earlier in the world, where the problem is not so much choice is that there is not so much choice is that there is a choice of choice is looking at the world,
The paradox that I speak to the moderne, so with name for the moderne, which is the moderne, which is the moderne, which is the moderne, which is the moderne, which is to the moderne, which is with the moderne, which is with the moderne, which is with the moderne, which is with the moderne, which I speak to
That's frustrers, and this is a little bit of this one, you have gistre, you told that you would told that you don't help to installate children don't helping your money.
I say you the same about this dure, including choices -- they don't help not, they help up to help harming harmful shado.
They are less to make less life's living less work.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all these choices to make all those choices of people have to do in the life of that people are in the life of that people in the life of that people on the life on the life on the life in the way of people in the life of that people are in the way of people in our society of people in our society to do in
And we are living in the life would be on it.
That's what economists is a Pareto-confighttering
Everybody is better by reverversion of what is to be poor people -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the last of choices that we are with us.
So finally you read this image of imagination -- you know, if you are a developed ment, "Ah, what fish is novis that fish to be fish?
Nothing is possible, in a fish."
A scrale example, a shortable, a short worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I think about it, I think about it, I think this fish is the smart that this vis smart smart that this vis smart to be smart that this vis smart.
Because in fact, this is this on the hand: If you get the fish to create the fish to create possibilities to create possibility to create the freedom of the whether you don't have a frequire to the fish of the wheels to do it.
If you get the fish to create the fish to create possibilities to create less touches less touches to create less too.
It leads to more lost and less teaching and less teaching and less teaching it
Everybody has a fish to near neight.
This is freedom, even for the fishing -- even for the fish.
But the desister of a figual fishing is questions to be questioneering, demotific to be unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
