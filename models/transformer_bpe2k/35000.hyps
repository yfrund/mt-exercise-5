Last year I showed these two slides to show that the polar caps, which was the pooly three million years about the size of the United Statand of 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the way that this particular problem because it wasn't showing the dished of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this particular problem because it wasn't showing the disheat the present of this particular problem.
The vococcupation on the North Pole is in a constitution of our global climate system.
It turns out in the summer, and crazy.
The next slide I shows is a spent version of what happens is happened in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is done is in red.
As you see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the annual ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
And the so-called ice ice ice ice five years or older, or older, is almost like blood, that from the body is soils here.
In 25 years is it from this to 25 years of this is going to go on this way.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen ground the Northern Icels and there are a very large amount of frozen woman, and there's a very large amount of carbon is that when it was deforce microbes in methane.
Consider to the total amount of disconcerned in the atmosphere, that could double that can double as we divide the point of the point.
In some undeep deep deep and, in Alaska signs of methane in Alaska signal of the water.
And the last winter was going to be a different team was from the University of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another team to another team to a different team to another one deep on the other team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to the University
Whoo! She's OK. The question is right.
A reason for that, this is that this enormous warmer Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of that is going to warming out of the north of that,
This is a meltwater river.
The water volume is the waterme is the bigger than evil
This is the Kangerlussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea sques because it is the landy ms, it's the place where it comes into the sea.
These strains are taking takes flight.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice on Earth.
And the last month reported scientists that all has been a negative ice balance.
More specifically the ice in the weast. in the weast.
The whole continent is for six meters of sea-foot sea-stying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice ice ice ice massa, there are new now, who were still glaciers were still glaciers were still glaciers were going to be a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the half of his drinking water is that meltaborate at that melabor.
In the Andes, this glestjer the source of drinking water for this city.
There's more straight now.
But when they disappears also disappears the drinkwater.
In California, there was a 40 percent in the snow, of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions seriously.
This global dreams to have a dramatically provide a dramatically free of forest fuels.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen seen speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the front 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping big.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 tons every 24 hours,
25 mios and ton every day in our oceans, look at the east area of the Stille Ocean, and every size of America, and to every single side, and on every single size of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dalation of the oceans.
The only big cause of the global warming, the earth, beside-deforest, which is the burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and steenkool is the most biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extent of China.
And there was a lot more of coal to build a lot more coal-carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon centrales.
But we see a cirmess.
These are the coal-carbon which the bitch of building became annual years and where green alternatives were present alternatives were forget
There's a political fight on the way to the gang in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industrial gave 250 million dollars of to promote "scanswer coal coal coal coal coal -- which is a conversation of the conversation of the conversation of the operation.
And that image did something about something like that.
And on the homor in Tennessee, in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons carbon model.
You probably seen it in the news.
This is the one after largest waste solid of America.
This happened to the Kerst.
One of the advertisements of the cooking on the link was these.
Video: "Frosty the stead, the stead, is a key cool, a guy of challenge guy.
He's overliquid to this in America, and he is growing our economy.
Frosty the stead, with the day of the day is scanness.
He's paid and cute and cute and employees keep their job."
Here's a big part of the steenkool in West Virginia foot of froms.
The largest mines of the country is the big bad of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be obvious to be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know where they talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection for two campaigns on the road of a too.
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Video "Bine COLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat, as a serious threat.
That's why the reason the reason the most important goal is to give us a giant concerned to advertising for the light and bring the light and the regular of the truth of values of truth about stead.
Finy, bittingly is not smarious.
We find that the clean -- and it still cross it still couldn't be a cross ck.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just talk about us.
Video: Schone of the cool, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shells on this hyper-carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon on this hypermodern shored by this hypermodern shone.
Fantastic! The machines are pretty much a little bit of noise.
But that's the sound of clean coal-coal technology.
Despite the fact that the sance of the most important causes of the most important causes of the Earth is changing the Earth is changing shoot that you see everything.
Look at the time is the clean coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, past the positive alternative with our economic challenges and that they were on the area of national security.
Video: Stem: America is the economy, the economy, the economy, the national security of the climate crisis.
The red wire wire is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel like coal and imported oil,
But now there's a new solution to get out of this.
And far America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get a plan to work on the work to do a plan that makes us safer and the global warming of the Earth to.
Finally, a solution that is a solution that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Design.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's about to give America to energy.
One of the fastest ways to make a end of our dependence of old to our dependence of old fuels that help our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
Man 2: New investments to create jobs.
Voice: Repower America. Time to become realistic
Al Gore: There's an old African old African speakword that says, "If you want to be quickly.
If you want to go far and go together."
We need to go far about, and quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how this machine works.
So here I'm a little bit of those who didn't waren't waren't warens: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever taken up 27 miles in the engineer.
It has to do the circumstances that were dealing the circumstances that was beginning the universe started to be 600 million times a second after the universe was beginning to do a second.
Enorm ambitius, right?
This is the machine under Geneva.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one where I work. It's called the ATLA, detector -- 44 meters wood.
Spectacular picture of ATLA, and AS, so you can see the scale.
And in the first of seeptember 1, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That causes a partment in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that was going to go all around the LHC and put up with a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC, who were in the detector flow slow in the detector.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September the machine was working that worked on the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this was the largest application, or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page looked like like this.
That means that we made a kind of cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden behaviors.
They were 13 thousand ample of ampe-thousand ample when the machine works.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that do because they are superago, because they are super-a-temperaturs.
So on the mind of 271 degrees, cold space between the stars, that can be able to behavior.
In one of the connections between the nine of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And it was a wire wire of it was something like that, and was electric resistant resistance to 13 thousand ample of course.
This was the result.
This is another impressive if you realize that those magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons more than 20 tons -- and they were about 30 inches.
We were damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out out of it, what we did.
We all have repair of them in the way that we all saved it.
Now they're on a road.
Eind map the LHC will be againtact.
We're going to put it back back and we expect measure in june or right so we can go further with the expect of the universe.
Now, of course, they have started about the debate again the debate again about the value of scientific studies. It's easy to convenient study.
I think the fact that it's so hard to be so hard to go further than the LHC.
I let the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I was divided to do the disdes of the value of his learning was Michael Farage, his leather was Michael Faraelto, "None is so dangerous for the progress of human mind that we are not going to be there that there are not a mysterive, that there are no new to be no new to be not a new world."
Thank you very much.
I would want to start to ask to ask you to ask to your children at your childhood time when you played with blocks.
When you discovered how you were going to grab it up and conscious, you actually were problems to solve with the deal with and hanging on the engineering with and the space relationships.
Rumtelevision is very strong consider to understand the world around us.
If a information that if an information inspired by the physical interaction with objects -- with my advisor Pattion and my fish Pattion and my compassion -- I started to ask me to ask me to ask me -- what if we would use a computer of the engineering -- what if we would have to do is a kind of digital free that moves on an individual deves, which is going to move information that is to be information with with the information of information that are physically moves in the world of individual information that we can have to be information of individual information that moves and we can devast information that moves in the way to moves on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on a planplanplanet an an an indivi
and can ordering orders, as we want to do
And this question was asking us so that we decided to find an answer by the building of Siftables.
Sort together is a Siftable computer size a computer size of a cooky.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel each other, they can feel their movement, and they contain a screen and wireless.
The nuclear understanding is the physical act, just like blocks like blocks like blocks like blocks like blocks to grab.
And Siftings are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulation of digital information.
And this is that these aid resources have a more physical different, and even more conscious of their movement, and even of the way we move and neat interactions of which are different new and fun interactions of the way we move to explore them, there are different new and nice of the way we move with their movement,
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that play by changing opportunities and others and others and others played and others played it.
This interactive portraits of interactive portraits of each other.
Indians next to each other other to interest to each other to interested in each other.
If they are surround, they also find surrounded it and can be a little bit and become some nervous.
And then they feel movement, and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of everyday is the use of the cooperation of a color as it was a fluid as it was a fluid of color as it was a liquid of color as it was a liquid of this interaction,
In this example three Siftables of this example for and I can use them to use to be color in a very empty totally too much.
If we have over, we went out to the same thing.
There are some of the crap of opportunities for education, mathematics and mathematics and logic and logic that we want to give people the opportunity to progress things rap, and the result immediately untinately seeasy to see things quickly immediately well.
Here's showing -- this is the development of a Fibonacci running through a simple acci square programmate.
Here's a game that a game of a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle, is that you get in every Siftther arban arby, and shaped in every Siftable, and you know, a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it's very rescue, and applies a new series of letters with a very homomber to be a new series of letters with a very shapes to be a new series of letters with a very rescue,
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm not sleeping them out and I have a video of it.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed almost not need instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Most word and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here's some other people test the tests.
That's our youngest ber right at the right botom.
Bs that it was wrong the Siftables would.
For him were just blocks.
Here's an interactive paintingly painted a interactive paint.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning from language.
This is Felix that demonstrates.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that carakters of the table of the table of the table of the table.
He's he leaves the sun rises.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he's got a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good godan! Yeah! Yeah!
By the screaming of Siftables and the needle to each other, he can respond to each other, Video: Work -- Video: Work the death -- Video: Wath death the wall!
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decided how it goes away it did.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example I'm going to show today Is a synthesizer and live music cstrument that we developed recent a sound produces a sound produces like the lead, bass and pressure drum.
Eender has four different variations, where you want to be able to use which you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in the art of injected so you can be determined to be determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way of a lecture of a livable effects of a livable effects and filter.
They are being able to be a sound applied and adapted by the office.
And if you have the general effects like tempo and volume that are allowed to the pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the pattern effects like tempo and volume that are being able to do the entire pattern effects like tempo and volume that are being admeso,
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, and a first pattern, lower by an extra lead.
Now, I put the basic line.
Video: DM: Now, I'm going to add some slaught work.
Video: And now I coppress, I coppress, so I can affect the effect live the effect live to the effect live in the press,
Video: DM: I can spend it very accelerating the dirty of the tempo blocky.
Video: DM: DM: Now I coppression to the bas for the bas for the bas for the expression.
Video: DM: I can reached the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything but I can improvise the very longer and shorter as I want to be able to improvise everything I want to be able to improvise everything to be able to improvise everything.
With the dimessage of the volume of the volume Siftable to left the left Siftable to the left Siftluence to the left Siftable to the left of the dimes.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion is to make new people from to the new people to make new people in the way our brain and work work better in the way our brains and working bodies.
And today I had to show you one new element in this design area of this design area that we are developing in this design area that we develop in the lab.
The thought I would like to bring about is that this is just the attention to a very new generation to the interacts for the interacts of the interacts of digital media, which bringing the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it out to talk to you all to you all the time.
I'm writing.
Books write is my work, but also write so much more than that.
My entire life long I've been involved from writing and I don't think that ever going to change.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career, and career, which is that I had to be relationship my work with my work to be relate to my work to be released with my work again.
It started with a book that I wrote along the way that I wrote on a memoire: Bids, Beminnera that very very contradiction to my early work on the world was going to be an international exister and an international exister celler.
And the consequence is that people now have to be everywhere, and always touched as if I do do with it.
And the thing that -- the way -- it's called ""
People come to me and ask and ask care about care of you never afraid you never afraid you will be able to evenar?
Don't you do not afraid your entire life will be write your entire life will be a book that people will write for warm,
Don't you do for that?"
Experformance diamond; you know.
Of course, that would be very very of, I remember that I was a teenaged 20 years ago, if I told was a teenager, if I told was a teenager.
People said, "Don't you afraid you never afraid you never get succes?
Don't you know about it to be surface that you will be going to be on with it at the point of it is going to be able to be fright?
Don't you do your life on this work without a lot of this work without that there ever something that you will be something that you will be going to die, and you will be shaped on your mond biter as of fail?"
Something in that streting.
And in the short is my answer to ask on this no, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are called the things that are called
All right.
But I'm also for a lot of other things are afraid of other things that all of the things that all of it.
For example, and other engineer, and other things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time is the last time when this is the last time to come from.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be a job for working to work for which they are to their opinion on Earth are see?
What is that creative is creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the minesses of minesses that we make it on the mindslightly something that happens in other species is not going to be happening.
Take my father. He was chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was a little bit of the 40 years he ever asked someone has asked somebody ever asked him there for him or he was not afraid for it.
And that's how to say, "Yohn, how do it with your chemist?"
No, no, it wasn't talking about it.
To fair is cheis: People engineers have been not a reputation of the centuries of the reputation of manical depressive alcohostholiphones.
Scircle of writers have this kind of reputation.
Not only writer, also other creative people have been a reputation mentation mentation mental reputation of mental instable.
And just look at the grimming death the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
Many of many died young, often by own stified by own stified by own stiers.
And even those of you who don't seem to be suicide under their gavess.
In the last interview for his death said, "Miler: "Move each of my books is a piece of mine of myself."
That's pretty much about your life.
But of this kind of spoke of this kind of spoke of this kind of spoty.
We all have heard it all earlier and have it accepted.
The reason the connection is that creativity is that creativity is unlocked with suffering and that a artist will lead to miserable to lead to misere.
So I want to ask everybody here today is to ask that idea life?
Do you do that OK?
Because I'm going to be a good about it, I think it's not a very good thought.
I think it is the resident.
And also even more dangerous.
I would not like to see that this century also as well.
We can creative minds a lot better than to live.
I'm sure that for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live to that dark in the dark of the dark of mind.
Surely seen the phase of my career is now in the face is now
Go took only young, a high-young, a high-hold.
I can spend four decades to do a couple of decades.
Hharvested probably everything I'm now going to be now in the outside world, as a work that extraordinary successful book successful book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can probably be a little bit of the most success of the most success of my largest success of me.
Jemig, which is an idea!
If you think about this is you know it for you know it in the morning to the negin the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love love to the work that I love work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
After long as I think I'm going to be the conclusion that I can just go through with write as I can just go through a psychological protection in the process.
I have to create a write distance of a settily distance between myself and my consider very very very understanding fears for the reactional publications.
I did it for the last year to ways to do that.
I'm in the history of the history and I do in other civilizations to see or others to see or others to be a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My quest me my quest has brought me to the old Greeks and Romeinas and Romeins.
And I think because it's a long time and complicated story.
In the old Greek and Romain and Rombs and believed that creativity was from herrself.
And they believed that creativity was a godal mind that was a divable place to human beings -- and unknown place, to be more failure, and unknowledges.
The Greeks called these Greeks called these creativity of creativity "demonen."
And Socrate that he had a demon who had a demon had a demon that he had been able to refluist.
The Rombs had a species of the Rombs had a kind of thing.
And when they was about this deal with them was a "genious genius called a genius
And the funny is that the Romb with a genius with a genius are not a particular piently.
In their policy was a genius was a kind of magical goddal entitt that were assemble in the walls of the arty.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house.
If the artist was working on the work was working on the genius assistance.
Seviable he gave shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
And everybody knew how that was working in his work was going to do it.
The artist was taken as protection to the press for example,
If you were brilliant work was brilliant to be all the hall.
Everybody knew that a knew that a invisible genius you had helped
Where's a work close to you, and you have seen that not only about you,
And everybody knew you had a rather independent geniius genius.
Lge time is that the way in the Western creativity was considered to be considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There is a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual human is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the godal world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual lot.
And for the first time in the history of the first time was said about artists that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they were a genius and haven't been a genius to have a genius and haven't been a genius in the history of the first time in history of the first time in history of the first time in the first time in history of the first time in the first time of the first time of the first time
I have to say that I find a big mistake I find a big mistake
To person, one person, one individual individual that he or she is the climb, the essentially mystery, the essential mystery, of everything that creative -- that's too much more responsible for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun into swallows the sun
Egos are remodity to gigantic proportions and there are incredible expectations to be represtently copposed to be refrigerate.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think is the question, I think is the question, "What now?"
Can we do these?
Can we go back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship of the relationship between the relationship of the relationship between the relationship of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship of the relationship between the relationship of the relationship of the relationship between the relationship
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years we can make rational humanism not undone in a 18 minutes,
Probably in the audience people who have recently recently read about the idea that elfell that is a lot of the idea that elfar creatures with some feeent of the work of artists.
It doesn't seem to me, I don't look at me in that.
And yet I'm going to ask it up.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we have the thought of the thought of the think?
It just felt as much as well, as much as all the other explanations of the totally calculation that are decided to be creative in the creative process.
And everybody who have to create something to create something -- so in fact, all of the attacks -- you know that the creative process is not always rational mous.
And that sometimes it took almost paranormal.
I have been going to have the great American closer Ruth Stone of the great American close to be
She's thick in the nine. Her entire life already writing already writing them.
She told me about her childhood on the country of Virginia.
Some times when she was on the field of the work, felt she was a poem about the country.
And she was so one, as if there was a big wave air in a big wave air
And so that I poem about the country to her --
She felt that the ground under her feet started to shake her at that time, but one thing to do was just one thing to do was --
She ran home, back to the poem and she had to do the poem and she had to do it paper.
When the poem came through her heen waves her hand her only was that her only chance to write it on the way to do it on the way to write it was that her only came up with her heen wave heen wave with her heen hand her hand write it was that they were close to do it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then and ring them, but it doesn't reachieve the house.
And at this time, the poets the poem of her him, disappeared, sears -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poem.
And also also had a little bit -- this I think the most beautiful part of the story -- that they are almost the close to be the close to be the close to be a close to be the close to do --
And then she was looking for the paper and paper and paper and they shoot the paper and the paper of her hids.
Just at that time, she had a potleat.
And with her other hand, so told me them, she was told me the poem of the air.
She paked the poem at the tail and it back into her body, and it back into her body, while she wrote it up.
And in that case, the poem was very close to be very close to paper, but in the wrong order.
When I heard that -- what I thought -- which is accidentally, I thought of the creative proces!
That's how my creative process! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, which every day every day on the same time time on the same time of time and swed, sweand trans through it.
But even in that daily swran an an an experience.
You also will know it also that you can know it sense that there are a bird of a source that you can identify impossible to identified.
What's that then for the brone?
How can we use it without that we become that without a way that we become that without we become that without we become that without we become that without we become that we become that we become that without we become that without we become that without we become that without we become that without we become that without we become that without we become that without we become that use we become
And in a way that is good for us to do it?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is music to think is a music way that I can think of this is a music way that I can think of this is a music way I can think about this is a music ine-porain this is a music way I can think of this is a best contemporain contemporain
A few years ago, I was interviewed to a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life has been shown in the toonic of the contemporary artistic artists that are trying to get out of all the power of the unconnections to the unfortune that allow in him to impulses in him.
With the years was Tom a little bit of the rustiger.
And one day he reached in Los Angeles about the fast road, and changed the process of radical --
And as he heard about there he heard about a fragment,
And the decided to him, like inspiration that does does crowl, cwell.
It was a beautiful melodies, and he wanted to fashion it to fashion that we were going to hit the vasthor.
But it wasn't going to do that.
He had no paper touch, no pen, no taperececorder to be a table to be a table to the task of a paper at the time.
The well-known tension took again is of the galodies that requires and then it stays and then it stays to me backkwheels,
I'm not good enough, I can't be it."
He was not getting in panick, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new --
He looked up to the air and he looked at the air and said, "Sorry I sat the air and he looked at the end?"
"Do you really think I can write a song,
If you really want this song to come later you have to do later another time for you.
Don't be a little bit of falls.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment when the time was losing process.
And the work is still the work, with the famous dark of the dark of the dark of the work is at the dark itself is the work.
But the heavy that creative the creative process in him review of the genius of the genius of genius as a distance of genius.
The genius was going to be close to the skin, and saffer and selling it on the soil.
Bom realized that there was no reason to go on the bottom to go on and do it at the botom.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre cooperation between Tom and and the profoundation between Tom and the own,
And that story has changed.
I've been doing it for a profijer of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bids, Bids, Bids, Beminning.
And at a point moment I felt in desperation.
You know that you want to work but not good working, you don't want to do it is a terrible disagree.
Not just just bad a bad really horrible bad of it.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project all of the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that was remember and I decided to be a postent attempt.
I wentered from my manuscrips and focused and direct me to a very empty corner of the room.
And I said to say, "Listen throw then, we know all of that if this book is not just because of me.
You can see that I have in what I have in my mind.
More I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it better than you have to do your thing to do is to be doing your thing to do is
Did you don't do that, you won't be that.
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notabulal is that you are just going to be a chance of the office."
Tja--- Usand, it comes up to this ...
Euwen ago, in the North African desert people together to dance in the North African ance music.
Uren and hours, to the morning to the morning glors.
That was always amazing because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, something, something extraordinary happened to be an extraordinary.
One of those dancers than transcendent.
You know that you know some of the thing I mean, you ever see you ever seen something something at a performer.
It was as if the time was stilling and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights -- but now I have everything.
And he didn't just seem to be a human beings just a human being.
In him, above him, above him is above him on it.
A guy four through a guy him.
If something happened, if something happened, knew people were started to clap them and clap them and clap and clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because that was for them.
By the way, a fun historic fact, and a fun of the people were conquire conover, they brought this living with it.
The spoke is the spoke is equivalent of "Allah" in "Allah" in "Olly" in "Olly."
And that hear you today today in the day of flaments and flaments and flaments and flamental government.
If an artist in Spain something impossible or magical does, or magical does, oil people, ole, oil Allah, olone, or Allah, great, brain -- and great, or or magical does, or magical does, or magical does, or magical does, or
Seapapary, disease, a glimpse of God.
And the thing we need.
Lasty is the dance is that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to discovered on dinsday to be 11 a.D.
And at that moment he's again a little bit of elder guy with remains that will never come to be able to come to such more to be able to come up to such more to be able to come up with remains that will never come to such more to be able to come to be a little bit of parent.
Maybe there will never attach anybody God will be dance.
What do he now has to do with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to sell a difficult to a creative mind.
But it's not going to be as painful high to be as painful.
Imagine that you don't know that the most unusual aspects of your person from your person from your person from you.
And imagine you believe them that you have a while a while, from a while,
When you are ready with it, they are giving to somebody else.
That's how it does it counts everything.
I hang in average that I think is a thought of the thought of the average of the average of the mind.
And the last months I've been working on a book that will be short to be a book that much soon will be excited.
The operation of that illuster progress.
If my mind to go on the hall, I like to go and I think the same ones don't know the same one.
Do just you work.
And just if you do thing -- you do -- you see the thing it is.
If you're task you to dance your job is to dance your job.
If the divent genius that you have been contained to leave in your work at some time at a little bit of the wonderful source of the wonderful source -- "Oly."
And it turns out that not, thanks and wrong it away at it it
And also "Oly!"
I believe that of hard.
"Oh, anyway, where, because we have a pure human love and property, because we stay through plumb and property.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I've had talked about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome, and what that can mean and what that can mean and discover sets of genes.
And we actually started from a new point: we were the biology to the biology to the digital code and now we try to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology with the design and synthesize and synthesize life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions to ask the big questions
"What is life?" is something I think I think have tried to understand the lot of biologists have tried to understand in different levels.
We tried different approaches of different approaches to minimal minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitize now --
When we have sequence, the human genome genome genome. And then went from the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask and question: can we regenerate life -- or can we create new life out of this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium for a kind of that can remove in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get a nature smaller genome.
We can cut in the order of hundred and look out of the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical map that relatively compared to the metabolan to the use.
And I think this is simply simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch a piece of the genes that would be a living cell cell cell about it.
So we decided to do that the only route that the only route to synthesize this chromosome, so we could make the components to do the components to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started a chromosome,
Staat the chemistry to make these very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, if we do a chromosome, "rise start?"
A chromosome, by the way, a chemical ines and a little bit of chemical inds of material.
So, our shapes of the digitalization of life is accelerator is accelerating.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather song of the genetic code.
And our last point it would take an exponential curve.
We're talking about 15 years ago,
There were some stages for a few stages for a bio-ethic ethic ethic acction of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be a little bit of the synthesis the synthesis the synthesis of
There are tiends of thousands of machines in the world that make little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it pieces are the piece of them,
So we had to make a new method for the condition of these little pieces and corrigate the corrigate of all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death that kills bacteria --
We designed the pieces, the pieces, did the mistake --
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we put a piece of chemical chemical chemical chemical tria genetic code and making the genetic code and virral particles are going to make a little bit of the engineering of the engineering parts and make virtually have the genetic code in the bacteria --
The viral particles were going to be when they were walked out of the cells, they came back and kill the E.
I was a conversation with the oil industry, and I said they could, and I said they couldn't be moving to be model with the oil industry,
They laughing more than you lose
So we think this is a situation where the software can build its own hardware can build in a biological system.
But we wanted something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could various experience --
to understand what the realm is to understand what the reality is of a living cell cell.
The design is critical critical and if you start start with digital information in the computer than to be very accuraatate.
When we first did the first time we were the first time in 1995, the standard Preached one a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing, 30 mistaks. If we had the original sequencing. If we had had been able to start.
Some of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so much smaller sub-onities unities that we need to design so that they can go together.
We design design in this way.
Maybe you have read that we put out there in the water markarks in it.
Bethink we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, GG, and T.
Trios of those letters code for 20 aminozurs -- that there's a little bit of an amazor -- that there's a literal attace for every aminoxygen out.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, s; so, though.
Aanvanly we cut up only a lot of it.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of the bunch of these pieces that were five to 7,000 letters long, just just severe of 24,000 letter, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
And in every stage of the stage of every single soil, so we could sequences because we could create a process that is very robust -- that you will see straight that you will see straight -- that will show you you are sequences to see the street that you will see steak you see steahead -- that will be sequences you know, sequences that you will see step -- that you will se
We try to achieve the point of automatishing the point of automatisfaction.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 bases, they don't grow as easy more in E.
That turns the most of the modern tools of the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to read to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that homologe recombination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair DNA can feet.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinocococococococococococococococococococococococococococococococococococococococococococococcus raduransoduranian called Deinococococococococococcus radurance radiodurance to radiodurance on the way of radiod
And that is in the top panel, sophic is just just switch to do the ones are just approximately out of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later and put it back into the one of the other --
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drought up to be totally drought up.
They can live in a vacum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space that can find itself move to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of the way, there is a lot of the way out there is a lot of the way.
Here's a desire micro-phone-phone-that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with this processes with the right design of the pieces that we did in the right design of the pieces that we did in the way.
Gres care that they add automatically add automatically
This is not an electron-microscope photograph. This is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken about a six seconds.
This is the publication that we spent recently, we spent undevice.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecuulbbalance is over 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, you know, 142 pages to the genetic code.
Good, how do we started a chromosome? How do we activate the way we do it?
And with a virus is a clearly easy to be pretty easy --
And with a bacteria is a lot more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give up under eukaryots, like us, you just what, you just whose you know what, and that's what you know as the clones.
And if you look at the bacteria species of chromosome, but we have to do a complete transplantation that we can do a complete transplantation of a chromosome.
We have a chromosome, and iverted from a microm of a microm species.
These are about as far from each other as people and mices.
We added some extra little bit of extra chromosome.
We have distant to make it with enzymes to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be able to have the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome,
And we even thought he would come to the solid of the process of what we were trying to move the process of what we were trying to get out of the process of what we were going to come out of the process of what we were going to come out to the so.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of of which have taken a second chromosome, or a third chromosome, and they add thousands of owns in one time to the species.
People who prevent evolution as if you have one changes at the same time,
There are enzymes that are restrict enzymes that are actually called DNA.
The chromosome, in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome, we put in it --
It was expression, and it was express the other chromosome, as a strange of material, and so we finally had the cell of the new chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in very short time disappeared, all the characteristics of one species, and changed in the new species, based on the new software that we put in the cell software that we put in the cell of the cell software that we put in the cell of the new software that we put in the cell software that we put in the cell of the new software that we put in the cell.
All proteins changed, the membranes changed the genetic code -- when we laughing, it was changed.
This is a monkey as genomic, but we're in state, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change.
Good, I've been paid earlier that this is not a creation -- this is a front of boarduring -- this is a new version of the Cambran explosion of the Cambran explosion of the Cambran explosion of the Cambran explosion of the Cambran explosion of this digital design is based on this digital design is based on this digital design design design
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly obvious if you look at what is it need.
We're going to go in soon, and a half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet;
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46, that will be four are going to be four that are going to be four in 1946,
We have trouble with food, with the healthcare of clean water, drugs, fuel for the six-and-a-half billion.
That's hard to do that for nine to do that for nine to do that for nine to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of collapse more than 30 billion vessels of coly.
That's 100 miloons of freezing a day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever processes or what process is to replace, and that's going to be a huge challenge.
And then of course, there's all the carbon dioxide of the dust that come in the atmosphere is a term.
And by all our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen components, and look at the diversity that has come out of there are different comes.
We're very constently limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques of techniques of synthesesemethods to do so-called combination genomics."
We now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the distribution of 20 million different genes, or try to optimate processes to make octan octan octan octan to produce or drugs, we can change with a little team of team is doing more molecular biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's only a lot of a selection.
We can select select for livbirth, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design image of what real designs that we work on and so you can actually go on the gang and a new kind of a new kind of computer.
We don't know person how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus now on fourth generation fuels.
Remember on the ground of ethanol anol anol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuelds that will come out of sugar, to more high-fuel-scale fuels like octan octan octan or different different different different species like octanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have big big food without the food without the food prices and the availability to reduce the way we start with CO2 as his food, and so we are the first food of the food of that we do the first five to that way, and we think we are the first fourth generation to have the first generation of 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwide, we have all kinds of other methos.
This is an organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea, about 2.5 miles deep, at cooking him in cooking shealthy temperatural.
It makes methane to CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy sources as energy sources as energy sources.
We're looking at whether we can take CO2 CO2 -- which can be easy through path, which is easily through the CO2 to send this process, where that CO2 to send this process.
So in a short time spent in a short time we are able to extend to the basal question, "What is life?"
We realize you know -- you know -- you know -- the protectic industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can't do this, where you can do it at TED,
A important energy source is going to be a important source of energy source.
But we also work on the way of using these tools to think about quickly.
This year there was the flu -- we always walk just something behind the facts as it comes on the right vaccine.
I think that can change by by creating vaccines of teformed vaccines.
And here you see how the future can see what the future can now change the evolution tree is going to change the accelerating evolution tree bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're still away from humans to improve people.
Our goal is survive that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive to do that probably do it in a long time.
What I want to show you as first quickly, is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to be about a year technology that we brought to be a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a surrounded that you locally or on the distance with immense amounts of data visual data visual data visual data visual data
We look at a lot of gigabytes to digital images and can stay on this -- and you know, and excise the order and challenge to our wish to our wish to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big we are these collections or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress and is the 300 megapixel crazy.
It all doesn't matter because it is because it just because it was the only thing that would affect the amount of the same way that pixels on the screen on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a completely book, an example of data.
This is the graug house by Dickens. Each column,
To prove that it is really text is really text -- and not a image, and we can do something that really text is really text -- this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a strange way to read a h-book way to read an e-book in an e-book way to read a strange way to read a little bit of an e-book way to read a strange way to read a little bit of an e-book way to read a strange way to read
I wouldn't add it to it.
This is a realistic example. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of an underlying of an underled.
This is really gives you really the pleasure of a real paper time or heads, or hether or headline, or heapers or newspapers or newspaper,
We also did something that we did with the corner of this spot of The Guardian
We made a nice advertention of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information --
If you want to see the opportunities of this car car, you see it here.
or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make it for constraints of hands, we can do the limitations of the screen at the screen eventually
We hope that this is not a pop-ups and other things that will be more popped flaw -- not needed to be more population -- not needed to be more popped with it.
Of course are a maps of the maps of the candle of a technology like this, I'm going to spend here to spend here is a lot of time to spending this fields that we can contribute to this fields are also a lot of the contraction of a lot of the maps are also a lot of the conditions.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and on top on the top of the NASA.
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, which are two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, proveness, proveness, proveness, on the University of Washington University at U..W.
and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation of cooperation
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see that we can experience through the images and the multiresolution.
The space dishe'd be the images has meaned here.
The computer vision algorithms have brought these images are bring with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized diashhows or panoria hot of images.
I'm not sure or there is another time or there is another engineering to show you a lot of time.
There are a lot of space television.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we worked in my head is the communicate of the communicate what I have in my head is the reality of this technique, at the environments on our website.
We had to do it with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Damam, with images from Flickr. You just searched on Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and third one.
And each of these orange chains giving a image that was a picture of this model turns out to be a picture of this model of this model turns out to be a picture of this model of this model turns out to be a picture image again that model.
And so these are all that Flickr images that are spent in this way of speaking in this way.
And we can do at simple way to navigate at simple way to navigate at the time.
You know, I never thought I would have ever thought I would ever work.
It's overwhelming to be this is going to be so device.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are cameras are cameras -- everything from gooflexcameras, a large number of it, considered in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so many covers and so on.
And nowhere between this is even a series of pictures -- here they are --
This is even a poster of the Notre that is also churched by the program.
If we dive the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now the data -- of the entire collective memory of the entire of the entire thing looks like this, and it looks at the size of the things to each other.
All these pictures are constructed with each other, and shapes a very bigger than the shared of the parts.
You have a model that of the whole Earth is that all the Earth.
So this is a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Arded.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use, and also the benefits of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are being present data that somebody else somebody else in the way of matape that somebody else.
If somebody would want to get on all these heads and their names and their names and their names and their names are remodelaled with all that data, and I can use as a access to the space, which I use metap-versus of cross the space, and create with this kind of cross-up experience.
And of course, the be-product of this imments of this is an imments of every interesting place on Earth, who not only from the air photographs, satelietable, but also out of the collective images and other applications is dealing from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that makes you cope possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that can be dealed by everybody on the world together in the world together in the world together?
BA: Yeah. What this really is discovery.
It creates to your wish, hyperlinks between images between images between images of images.
And it does that based on the data in the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information which is available to do a lot of these images are available to do a lot of these images are available to do a lot of these images are available to the wealth of semantic information which is available to be semantic information that is availing a lot of exciting of semantic information which is a lot of semantic information which is availing a lot of semantimes.
When you look at the web page to image, you feel a search, and you have a search, and the text on the webpage of information about what the image represent.
What if now is that copped is to all your image?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of that. It's a classick networking effect. It's a classically, networking effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicition.
One of the intense pleasure of the intense of enographic research is the possibility to live between those who are not forgotten the old living lifetime in the wind, the profitable in the wind, the propertly, properly in the propertilizer plans.
The science that Jaguar-smans still are the Milky whether that the mythes of Inextent -- or that the mythes of inextractly with meaning or the Himalaya birth still making jaw of Dharma, you remember really are not just one in the anthropology is the world that we don't have a absolute suspect of the enabsolute saccount is just one of the reality,

A language is more than her word or her grammatical rules.
A language is a nice of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that allows the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century ancient old -- a dirty of mind, a mind, an ecosystem to spiritual spiritual opportunities.
And from that six-thousand talks today is the day half of the day's day's fluistenced with that.

They have a fall language and swell-marriage, which is called the linguistic exogamined exogamin: you have to married somebody speaking.
This has his roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary full of their houses, or seven languages, or seven language, but you never hear someone language, but you never hear somebody a language.
They listen to simply just and then speak and then we start talking to speak.
One of the fascinating stem that I've been lived with which I lived with the Waorani in Northern Ecuador, a content, a connect of the 1958 vice.
In 1957, five missionaries were trying to explain in 1957, but they made a critical error.
And it turns the air friendly seen photographs of themselves with our ideas, where they move that this has never seen a two-dimensional image had never seen a two-dimensional image had seen pictures of themselves with with us to the air that had never seen a two-dimensional images, and they have seen a two-dimensional ima
They were going to get the photographs and tried to find the shape the shape of the face.
When they had nothing they found out of the device they were able to do that the device with them with this -- after the missionaries were making missionaries to spear.
But the Waorani not just outside, not only outside.
Fifth of their deaths came out of the major of breaking out of the signments.
We could take genealogies to eight generations back to eight generations back to eight generations of a natural dead.
When we were wondering when we were going to died that one guy ever died from ancient -- and then he was amazing at the same time, and they had an amazing single away.
Their hunters were able to urine on 40 passes to distance and tell what animal was the kind of it.
Begin '80s, I got a amazing asses, when my professor I was asked to me if I wanted to go to Haiti to infilm genomes to infilm that the basis of president Duvaler as a profoundation of presidential elitecors as a also given solid to assumping out of presidential elitecors that are made to be made to assumping out of the power of the power of the power of the power of power of power of presses that is made of presolid in the power of the power of the power of
And to this sensational things to understand what to do is to understand what to do is a little bit about this particular belief of Vodou, which is not a cult of black magic.
It's a complex metaphysical worldvievievieview, very interesting.
Would I ask you to call the big world's big religions what would you say to you?
Christian is lam, and the bulb, and jodence, etc.
One continent to consider to consider from the attention that Africa had no religious religious belief, they had a religious belief, they had this.

What voodoo is so interesting is the living contention between the lives, and the deaths and the deaths and the deaths and the death.
The lives the mind.
The minds can be attacked under the Great Water, answering the dancing of the living time in which the living time in the living time that one becomes a sick moment the following moment the god.
So that's why foods are borrowing up, "You're going to go to the church and talk about God.
And we dancing in the temple, and God.' And because you're so far by the mind, what can you happen to be happen?
This leads to a amazing trance tunately trance that catches in trance that raffic glamset that leads to put the stream.
This is demonstrate demonstrates the opportunity of the mind to affect the body is extreme extreme extreme extreme is extreme extreme is extreme extreme is extreme extreme is extreme extreme as extreme is extreme extract when this is in extreme extreme is extreme extreme extreme is extreme extreme as this is extreme as this is extreme extract as this diment.
And of all the full of all I've ever lived with the Kogi the most extraordinary of Colombia.
And stem of the Tairona-civilization, which ever have the Cariban Cariban coast follows in the nasleep of the disconsidered of the distribution.
And they retrode back in a isolated volcanic mass that above the coast followed out the coast far.
In a blood continent to be a continent continent to consider this follow has never been considered by the Spaidents.
As are still getting through ritual priester is rather than priester is pretty extraining to priest is quite extraordinary.
The young acolites are going to be away with their families when they're three or four or four there.
They are becoming a world of darknis, in stones, in stones of food, 18 years on food, 18 years on the foot of glets;
Two periods of nine years, aware chosen to form the nine months of form that they into the shapes that they spend in the disconnect of their mother.
Now, they're now in wise of speaking in the front of the big mother.

Do you see you? It's like I say you go.
That's how beautiful it is real. It's to protect to protect itself the older brother.
According to them the younger brothers, which are responsible for the destroy of the world.
And on this point is the intuitiveau very important.
If we think about inhead, we often think about and landscape, and we often Rousin and the old factor, a idea that racistic in his simplicity in his simplicity.
Or we are going to say that these people's following closer to the Earth is than us.
Inheemistse folks are nor expectanctual nostalgy.
For both is very little space in the malaria moer square or in the malaria moving of Tibe. Desalniance temporal mystic of the Earth, and they have a traditional mystic of the Earth, which is basically consciously, but at a lot of subtillianeously subtily is based on a much more subtilliant that the idea is only to be only convent the idea that the idea is only in the livice.
What does that mean? It means that a little kid from the Andes, which is grown up with the belief that the mountain of the Andes, which will be a fundamental other human person will be human beings and a other relationship that will have a little kid from Montana, and then a little kid in Monta, and then a little kid is ready to mine.
Or it the life's living a lot of it is an irrelevant.
Interestingly the metaphor that defines the contention between the individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were to become crosses to become crosses.
And that made me another human than my friends of the Kwagiultil distant that those forests are the living of Kuxwhue and the Kuxwhuke, and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme of the world swwwheats of the world swired of the world swired of the world swwwheats.
These minds are important during their Hamatsa-inducation.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can create different realities of realities that can be understanding to some of the extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant. Take this plant. Take this plant.
It's a picture that I april in the North weast-Amazone nam.
This is ayahhuasca, the most powerful psychoactive willing from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating makes fascinating is not only the pharmacological potential of it, but how focused out of two sources.
And the solid there is a wooden of that contains carboline, harmaline and harmaline in the wallucinating light.
If you take the plant to take the plant, it looks like that a blue smokalm by your consciousness.
The plant is mixes with a cooper, Psychotria viridis.
The plant runs are powerful tryptamines, nauthyltry-brain-tune ptamine, 5-maine, 5-major global ptamine, 5-ptamine.
Do you ever seen the Yanomami as they were that snuts, that you know, substantives of different species that also methoxyltry-ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami as they were that snuts,
That powder your nose nose, is like a little bit of a game of a regular pictures, to move and the countries to a sea of electricity. This is not a divortion of electricity.
I tried to my professor, Richard Evan Shultanes, to convince -- a man who did a man who did deviced the psycheal agen's in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these trying, this tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect intricity, because if the effect is to experience the hallucination of the hallucination of their effect to take to be not to take their effect to take away from their effect channy game changing arm-hallucter: monoxiamine oxiamine oxidase.
They can only be orally taken oremerging with something that the monoamine of the square to be doing effect.
The fascinating is that the contain the limb-carbolines in the lian operating monoamine-suppressure support to activate the tryptamine. Itely, how can this follow in a flora of 80,000 plants of two morphological various species that are very larger than the shapes that are very large of the larger than the shapes?
We say eufemistic "trial and and ror," which is being demass is demas;
The Indians say, "The plants talked to us to talk to us, what does that mean? This stem mean, the Cofan, knowing 17 variants of ayahhuasca, who can identify all on large distance as one would be one kind of such as one would be a kind of supply as one kind of would be a kind of supply for the s.S.
If you ask their taxonomy how they bring their taxonomy in the way that you know something of plants who've got something of plants knew something of plants.
You know not not going to be at all? I said no." I said, "no."
And it turns out to be all 17 species in a night at a night at a night in different toones of lads.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of a lot of tells.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who are under that are under that are under to insimprovide them as a curious and colorful and colorful in the history of the real world, as it is the real world, is the real world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not going to be reminded to be his wars or his technological innovations, but rather if the era while, and the things we were in which we were in the massip-a-stroying destroy on the massive diversity on the planet. The problem is not change.
All cultures have always been shared to a dance with new life of a new life of opportunities.
Technology on itself is not the problem is not the problem of the problem is not the problem of the problem is also not the problem of the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians didn't stop Sioux stop Sioux indianimals and gave their pile, as as that Americans were to be able to be when they way.
It's not changing or technology that is driving the integrity of the eventually endanger. It's power.
It was wring face of the government.
And what you see in the world, you will find that it's not the fast of these cultures to disappeared.
These are dynamic living full of identified, which is identified, which is refer to their appropriate opportunities.
Or now is about this is now to the huge amount of the Penan, a nomadical disch South Asian Asian athic baby -- and with the last generation of the forest generation and prostitution to the reverse of service, and prostitution to the river, where you can see the river, looking at the river, looking at at at the slib of Borth -- where you can see is seem to be the sun,
to fill their ships with the mittribes with the anforest.
In the case, of the Yanomami are the disease that are indeed in the case, as a result of discovery of the discovery of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of studies, you see the wring face of political government.
Genoccide, the physical challenge of a people, but enocide, etnocide, the destroyed of a people, is not only being did, not only in many areas is a full of a development of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level on the basic level of the basic level.
I have a young colleague 9,000 miles about country, required to the land of Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And it axis when I came in Lhasa in the statistics that you heard about it.
6,000 monuments destroying monuments destrokd, 1.2 million people killed in the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was acknown to the Panchen Lama.
And on that he was based on that he was killed the Chinese invasion began to be killed in the way.
His unm flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people into Nepal --
His mother was prisonerset because she was rid.
He was the prison the prison when he was two sides when he was two -- because she didn't have hidated under her rock, because they don't care hidden him without him under her rock.
The sister that heldhaftist smoky was in a food,
And one day she got a day per accident on a domband from a pool. For this overover, they were shaped seven years ago.
The pain of Tibet can be until until the mind of the people is something to do is something to do to be flaw on the fast of the way to do you flaw on the way to do you on the fast of Tibet is something to be a slighting.
And finally, it comes up on a choice.
Would we go in a gray world of simple life or want a single world of diversity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said to her death that she peace we direction, amor, amor, amor, amor,
We would not only be the human imagination of the human imagination of a small model, but also we would have been demoted and forget that there are other options are also other options.
We can feel our kind of feel at the idea that our kind of only 150.000] years on Earth is about the earth is about the earth is about the earth is about the idea that our kind of only 15,000] year on Earth is about the idea that our kind of only 150.000] years on Earth is about [150.] years on Earth is about the idea that our kind of only 150.000.000.] years on Earth,
The Neolitic Revolution, which we gave agriculture to the cult of the did, when we were replaced in the seed of the shaman was replaced by the priester and we found a overshot specialization by the priests and we found a specialization by the proshaman was just 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is still not a 300 years old.
This surface is this surface history that we have not been the idea that we have all the answers to all the questions that will come the next millennia on our path.
If the intelliligentle's intelligent of people, are being asked to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we will discover again to be discover the opportunity to be what we are, a completely species that makes everything to work all the gars and can be bloom to be able to make all the the game of optimism.
This picture I have taken on the northern point of Baffin Island taken with Internet on narwal is your head.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextent '50s, to be moved to convergent our souverage in the 1950s,
The opa of Olayuk refusion,
The family are peace for his life and deployed him all his cars, all his tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Interin not afraid for the colle; they use it to use it.
The birth of their sleeas the bills of their sleeas in case of caribooks.
Olayuties wasn't afraid for the polar night or the storm that wind the storm that wind up.
He went out to outside, he was lived from sea hondense skin, and he was putting out the poop began to woman, he was the pamet.
He brought a low-played speekings on the side.
When the solid, he slaught a dog with it.
He recorded the dog and improvised a harnames and improvised a harnahine.
And from the ribbits the ribs he made a bit.
He was looking at a dog in the neighborhood, and disappeared, including cky, including poeps.
And this is going to talk about nothing to do with nothing that is symboll for the resistant of the Interminal of the Interminal of the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government the Interminal government of a piece of country, and Texas soon and Texas sames. It's called us new home. It's called us Nunavut.
It's independent. They remember all the soil of the ground of deground sts.
It's a amazing example of how a nation can be enough to make a nation enough to her people can be able to bite.
And finally, I think it's clear, I think it's clear, at least for who is required, that they actually don't actually get at the way at at the world's call.
They're somebody else at home country.
They are for twists of the human imagination, which are going to go back to the beginning of the time. And for us, the dreams of these children, just like the one of these children, are being in the unlimited of hope.
And what we finally do at National Geographic, is extractly from the idea that politicians never reached anything else.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic, but we believe that stories can change the world, and we probably the best tell the world, which we probably the best tell you the best tell you are 35 million times a month, we probably are 35 million times a month time share in 156 countries on on TV and our magazines a million-public.
We make a felt following to the eator to the eat, with our public, to such a way to such extraordinary cultural places, where the town, so hopefully affected by what he see, so hopefully the most important baration of the anthropology will be deserve in a way to life in a multiculultiplies and pluralistic world to live in a way to live in a multiploration and pluralistic world
which all of the way wisdom of all of the people, can contribute to our minds.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have a book that I have a book on a book of the book of the book of the book of the question.
Maybe you see paralls with information from other sources.
And I also try to put some some of the connecting you to have a little bit of you might have a meant to be a little bit of the connecting of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a connect.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To behold, the official dogma, of all the westere, industrialized societies.
And that is official dogma, as a follow: To sously, to get the most of our citizens on the highest level of our citizens possible individual freedom.
Freedom is an amazing equal part of the human beings of human being.
And the freedom of freedom to act, to revest a higher prosperity to reach a higher well.
The ultimate freedom, we find in choice.
More choices hold in that people have more freedom.
And more freedomatically means automatically more well-of-freedomatic freedomatically
This is so deep as deep in our society that nobody would reduce to do do at it.
And in our life is this dogma, a dogma,
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool. It's a middle great.
Even about dressings.
And at the time that 175 sizone tes are threats in my supermarket markets are extra-virgin oil and twice different bells and twice treatment.
And then you can make a touch of the case of the case between 175 species for you, for the case between 175 species for you nothing to it.
So that's the attacked of my supermarket.
Look at electronicastores. You can do itself your stereoset -- loud of them -- loud speakers, caseless, caselerator radio, disangle --
As one electronicastore.
You can put it up and a half million different systems, with parts of parts of that store.
Give -- you have a lot of choices -- you have a lot of choice.
As another example -- communication.
When I was young ago you could all kinds of phone services, you could ask all kinds of the Bell.
You don't home it it up. You don't bought it.
That was the way that had the advantage that it never got piece of the advantage that it never go.
And that time is forbaby.
Today, there are a lot of different appropriate of different applies of different across it.
And in order to cell phones is immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- who with the middle -- with m3-making gnipper and crackage and crackage --
And if you don't seen this model is not in the store of the store of the store. And you can be sure that happens to be soon that is happening.
The consequence, people come to the store and assume this question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No. No. No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do too much too much does not too much too much too much of the way that doesn't do too much too much too much of the way that doesn't do too much does not too much do
And also in aspects of life that are much more more more important than the attackle of stuff is this explosive increasing of choices a fact of choices a fact of choices a fact of choices are a fact.
Gealth care, and it's not in the U.S. As don't even even as you go to the doctors that you go to the doctor, and that you tell tell what you to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A A or or we can do Bray
A has this forward and after all, and after all.
Bs has this forward and nading. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doc, what do you find is you find out of the things?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front and the But, and the But, and the front of this forward and down.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dock, if you was me, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own inputs of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of patient of the patient of patient of the patient of patient of patient
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision, that the heavy of condition of things -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor is not the best condition to decide decision, and not the best condition to take decision, and the patient condition is to represent measures are made a lot of advantage much more recomment.
Good up catch that crazzy that because the goal group, you can't buy and I cannot buy --
Why do do do if we can't buy them, if we can't buy it?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctors to ask our doctors to ask that other market resources.
Our identity of us existing aspect of us exist, is now overbig, as you can see on this slide on this slide.
Our identity is losing our background.
We find ourselves out -- we just want to do ourselves,
Every single morning to the rise of the state you have to think what person you want to be your mind to be your mind.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that a time that freezes everybody out of the automatically that you could be as soon as possible to children began to children began to kids began to kids began to kids.
The only choice was choice with who, not when and what you did was going to do and what you do was fish.
Now is free everything for the operating.
I teach temporal to particular intelligent students, which I have double I have educated less househwork than early than early early than the early removed than the one.
They don't have heather or agree or air than in the early time.
No, they have pressure with choices.
"Will I say, "Will I not? Do I now marries?
Or will I wait? Let me first kids, or do I first kids, or a care?"
These are all single questions.
They go through to answer them to a answer to them as this means they don't get their househwork and then well-up and they don't care couple of the well.
And they have right. It's important living questions.
And then we come to work. Carl just already about that technology is allowing us to work every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, by the way, which I love secret I love the way WiFi does it does.
I don't know why, because I want to keep that place for myself.
But good, which keeps adapty, that we are going to be asking ourselves, or at the time, or now, or now, or now, or not.
We can look at a footbalwasting of our son on the one hand, with us on one hand, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and maybe our laptop on the other hand.
And even if they all out of the things that are we all every minute of that competition with all kinds of questions -- "Am I ask this phone calls answer?
Will I response to this emailing -- I write writing this letter?"
And even if the answer "Nee" is, we experience the football of our son in a very different way.
Where we also look at the big, the grand the grand materialistic things, living is a question of choose of choos: life is a matter of choos: life is a matter of things.
That's how the world looked like the world early saw the world early saw the world early looked like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of chooses.
And so the world looks right now.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad or bad bad or bad right?
The answer is, "Ja."
We all know what is good about is well-up what is good about it is bad to it.
That huge checicity has two effects, two effects, two effects on the human beings on the human being.
A very contradiction is that the paralyzing paralyzed than being being more than confreezing.
And with so many choices people find the hard to make a choice.
I'm going to give you a very dramatically example of of this is a research to voluntary pension planning.
A colleague, a colleague, and I got access to invest data from Vanguard, a big policy-major policy-one million employees about 2,000 vegetables about 2,000 vements.
And she found that for every 10 policies every 10 policies that have been took at the worked on the work-took two percent detected the partner of the work-up policy.
As five farming five percent less employees than at five than at five than five foundses. Why?
Because it is that it in fifoundly fifoundly to choose that people just remember the choices people just exactly to the next day, and that on.
And from the point comes down.
That doesn't just mean that people after their pensional degree after their pentil because they have seen because they have seen enough money had been seen that they have been so hard as a little bit of the kitchen was so hard to have a little bit of the work-degree for a little bit of the work-death death for a little bit of food,
And they were going to go to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose, forward to go on their nose.
The work-to-of-double to double their own contribution to double their own contribute to be a lot of the work-worked about their own contribute to double their own contribute to be able to double their own contributions.
So too much choices can be working on the way to work on the way to work
And I think the world is looks like that.
If it go to the century to the century to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be skeps, or you want to be the wrong funntion, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, also if we were the lost of our dishape, finally less tepeared, eventually less tepeace with the result than it would be if we had less options have had less options have had less options as we had fewer options are as well.
There are multiple reasons for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tallow to turn that the choice,
You ask in this case, you ask in that a other choice would have been better.
This dreamed alternative is that you get spids of your choice.
And then does speak to the enough of the choice, and the choice you made a good choice, even if it was a good choice.
The more options there are more options there are more to have to have a spits of uneasier of the chosen option.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
And then Dan Gilbert gave already on how often we depend the value of things that we are similar to the things that we comparate the things that we are similar to the value of the things that we depend the value of the things that we are worth the value of things that we require to the value of the things that we are often depending on
If you can inthink of alternatives, you can also see many alternatives of all alternatives that you determine demote many alternatives that you demostly detect the attraction.
That makes you fewer too, with the alternative that you chose you choose have.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you have a little bit of the excuses.
This is a little bit of the streetc.
This is a stel on vaof, in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive two-wound.
They are on a beautiful bat. No weather. No human being.
Don't be able to do it? "Don't be the man, "Move that man, "It's auught audience.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city.
I could be my car for the door parkers."
And he's about two weeks to the idea that he misline that he crimes every day is mislesing every day in a great parking place in a great parking place in a great parking place for every day to do a great parking place for every day to the idea that he misles.
And the substitutional costs that we have to have our choice, even if we make a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are more attract alternatives.
And those are presenting to us as a substitutional costs.
Another example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Life in the here, and for example, and you don't have to overcome things like that.
Another point is that you with every choice other choices.
And all of that other has so been so attract as well as the chosen option,
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this is my square to a new newspaded.
I walk almost always speaking to the split down.
Ber there was only one kind of speaking, and it bought it was incredibly uncomfortable to be incredibly uncomfortable to do it was incredibly enough and often enough enough and often enough enough and felt enough enough it OK.
And after years I went to the store for a new now.
I said, "Day, I want to do a speak of a speak."
And the storer said, "Would you smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Do you know if a rhy? Whilt you were whether a rhyth?
Do you do a breek effect?
Do you have something expanding or a little bit of pipes, or flink out, and he went through it.
I was spotle, and I was spotle, I said, "I want to say the only one's the only one."
He had no idea which was not a idea which was and so I have a long hours all the possible of the breeding of all the possible ones --
I was very honesty, I ended up the store of the store of the store of the breeding breedomb.
I had done better in the better -- I could do it better -- I could do it better.
But I don't felt better.
Why? Well, for myself, to explain this to, I wrote a book I wrote a book in a book in the way to do it.
The reason I don't feel better with all of the choice, was that I started expecting more to expect of the speed of a good speeding.
I started without any any expectation, because I just had one kind of spirit was one kind of spirit
And then it turned out there were different and one of them would be fast perfectly fast perfectly in the way.
And what I was good, but not perfect.
And so I compared my bold with my expectations, and that asked me with my expectations of me --
The more possibilities people have to have the more expectations they coostate about the deserves of those possibilities.
And that means that people are less testing with results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
