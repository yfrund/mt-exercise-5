Last year I showed this two dia's slide to show that the pool, that the pool, who had the last three million years of the vastable of the faster of the United States, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is the indeed of this specific problem because it doesn't deal the animals.
The ice skin on the North Post is in a sense in a sense of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summit.
The next slide that I shows is a quickly version of what happened to the last 25 years is happening to be happened to be happened to be happened to be happened to be happened version of what happened to the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years is happening to be the last 25 years of what happened to the next slide of what happened the last 25 years of what happened to the next 25 years
The permanently permanently in the prevented in red.
Like you see it out of the dark of dark in the dark of the dark of the dark of the disease.
That's the year, that is the year,
And the crimpt in the summer here.
It was so called the permanent ice ice five years or parender, is almost like blood that from the body is so-body, that from the body is so-silt and it up here.
In 25 years is the of this to this numbers of this one.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozen frozen Ick and it was a very big amount of women's fors and become a very big amount of woman.
And the surface of the total amount of the atmospher, that could be display that could be divided to be disappoint.
In some of the undeepe of the animals, in Alaska board, in the water.
And last winter went to the Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another one.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question is going to be that will be going to be able to be that.
A reason for that, is that this huge called warm-heart Greenland from the north of warms.
This is a melectwater river.
The water's echer is greater than it is a bigger than it.
This is the Kangerlussuain South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea is the sea is the nice mely, it is mely, that is the place where it comes in the sea --
These are taking the stroms.
On the other side of the planet on the planet, on the South Pole, the biggest mass on Earth.
And the last months rapported scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice of the entire right now.
More specifically is the ice in the west, of the South Pole, very quickly in the melts, with name of underwaters.
The whole continent to six meter seessentially like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the one after two after two after two after the biggest ice mass of years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of his drinking water of that melse.
In the Andes, is this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more strows.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California was a destink of 40 percent in the snow,
It comes in the water reservoires of the waters.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dream of the global tribes of a dramatical styers.
And the number of of course, the number of nature, with a incredible and never seen see that in the world is never seen see so.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at the bottom of a historic context than you can see what happened to see here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 appeared every 24 hour.
25 mios every day in our oceans, Kook at the east of the Stile of the Stille of the Stille of the Stille of the Indian approxed in the Indian subcontinent, there is a behavided in the ocean in the ocean in the oceans.
The only big causes of the earth of the Earth, the desperate of the earth, is the source of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and stepped the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extincluding together.
And there was a predict of a carbon centrales of building carbon centrales.
But we see a circle of the engineer.
These are the urban carbon centrales that the bultic centernatives, and where green alternatives.
There is a political streek of the gang in our country.
The urban carbon -- and oil industriry gave 250 million dollars to promotion, and the cool coal of cool and promotions.
And that was decide to something like something like this.
And on the guy was in Tennessee, about four in Tennessee, about four billion literally belied.
You have seen the probably in the news of the news
This is the one after one after one after the biggest of America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the voice,
Video: """Frosty the voice, a stage, and a stage, a stage, and a stage of challenged guy.
He's fluence in America, and he is in America, and he cars in America, and he is growth of our economy.
Frosty the urban carbon man is scene the day of the day.
He's paid and scattile and employees their bunch and employed."
This is a big part of the voice of the voice in West Virginia of Virginia froms.
The biggest most of the country is the big bath of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be double Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know where they have it talked about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Kliense two campaigns on your campaigns on your your set.
This is a little bit of a this:
And I said, "By COALwory, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our business for our business for our business for our things.
That's why the reason is why the most important thing is to give us a gigantic behavior, to give the light and the reward of the light and the rewards of the value carbon the bone.
Feit is, stepping is not smart.
We find that it is shape, and it again, and it again,
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me show you all the way of us over.
Video: Acteur: Schone carbon carbon carbon it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern scale of well-carbon centrale.
Fantastic! The machines make the machines make the machines are pretty much as well.
But that's the sound of the sound of shour-carbon technology.
And despite the fact that the focus of the most important causes of the most important warming of the Earth is changing the opportunity of the Earth is shapes that you see all here.
Look at the way that is the shelling carbon technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative and that on the area of national safe.
Video: Stem: America sell in crisis, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The road is the rock of these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel and imported and imported oil.
But now there's a pursing new solution to get to this.
For of the America of 100 percent scuous celectricity, in 10 years.
A plan to get to the work on the work to get to get a safe that makes us safe and the operate of the Earth and the operating the Earth
And inally, a solution that enough of graduate enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. It's the way of the power of it.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's about the America to give America to give of America.
One of the fastest ways to make a end of our dependent of old fuel of old fuels that our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help up the end of the faster of the speed;
Man: Here's the future. Wind, and sun, a new energy system.
Man 2: Noo investments to create good paid paid good paid paid to create jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African old African speakings that says, "If you want to be everything.
If you want to go to together and whether to be together."
We need to go far and faster and faster fair.
Thank you.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back to a update about how that machine works.
So here I am the ones that there are not that there are not the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever entrement, 27 miles in the enomb.
It has to be the circumstances that were dealing the conversation of the universe started to 600 million times a second nabost second after 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition,
This is the machine under Geneneney.
We took pictures of that least in the mini-Bangs in detectors that I work. It's called ATLAS detector -- 44 meters -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the connect so you can see the scale.
At 10 september of the first time we put the machine for the first time.
This photographs by ATLAS.
And that carried a feestimate in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle that was the first particle that all around the LHC went around the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which were flowed in the detector of the detect of the first particles of the detect of the first particular particular particular particles that was a picture of the first
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September of September that we knew that is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the biggest across the biggest and saw that the Internet page and saw that the Internet page of the internet page of saw it out of the point of the point of the point of it.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact of the scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact of a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we have a cultural as a scientific impact of a scienti
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what was to do with these golds.
They were 13 thousand circle of amp-thousand calls of power.
The engineers will say, "Not that will say, "Not true.
They can do that because they're superidented to be on very lower temperaturies.
So on the min 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can be behavided that radid.
In one of the connections between the neine of the nets of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive of the neine of the neine of the constructive of the next.
And it was the wire was something warmer, and it was intended to that 13 thousand circle of a thousand-campying.
This was the result.
This is still impressive if you realize that that that magnets that magnets more than 20 tons of the 20 tons of 30 inches were put in the way.
We had about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out out of it.
We all were touched them.
Now they're back on the way.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC against intouch of the LHC against intact.
We will be able to him and we expect measures in juni or right so we can go forward to look for what the building building the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have started to be unhappiness the debate of scientific research. It's easy easily to research.
I think it's the fact that it's so hard to be that is that we go further than the LHC.
I shows the last words of the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I think that we were destroyed to the deal of the value of the values of his teachers, this is so dangerous for the propertly, "Nsomething so dangerous for the progress of human mind that our images of our images of the most of the images of scientist that we are no new mysterions are not a new world's the world in the natural of the world's nature of the world's scientist and we are not going to discushead in the world's the last words of the world's words of the world, and that there are that there are that there are that there are no new new new new world that there are no new new new new environmenmenmenmenmenmental that there are
Thank you very much.
I would want to start to ask to ask back to your children to your children at your children at your children played with blocks
When you discovered how to grave it to grave it and conscious, and we were actually solve to the teach and trained up with and hands of space and hands of space relations.
Rut, Ruilian insight is destront of the world to understand the world.
If an information is inspired by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with my advisor Patttion and my compassion, I started to asking me -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer -- what if we would use a computer that would be used to be a computer that would be a kind of digital move that we could do with the information with the information of the information that we can move the information with the information of information that we can move information with the information with the information with the information with the information with with with with with the information of information of information of information of information that we can actually model.
and we can ordering the one?
This question of us so concerned that we decided to look at a point, by building Sifttables.
Like up a Sifttable to interactive computer in the size of a cow-size computer size a cows.
They can be put together with the hand they can feel together, their movement and they felt a screen and they put a screen and wire that they were going to be act.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handellots of the physical treatments can be put together by grains.
And the top of the Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And this is that these helping resources have a more physical different, and even of their movements of their movements and even of the way we move them to discover the way we move them to discover the way we move them to discover the way we move them to discover the way we move them to discover the way we move them to discover the way we mo
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is to tell a video to tell a video and tell you that by changing changing and others playful and others;
These interactive portraits of each other.
And Indians can put together, they will be interest in the conversation of interest in the conversation.
If they are ringly, they can also be able to be this and can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be so.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all of these interaction, as the challenges, like it was a low-like the foot of a wall.
In this example of three Sifttables of the example of them for and I can use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and get them to be ment.
If we have the threat, we went back to the back of the things that we have a little bit of the
There are some of the purpose of possibilities for education, especially players with language, and logics where we want to give people the possibility to probert the result of people to see the result of the immediately sseeing the result of the power.
This is the ton I -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci by a simple, by a simple computing programative mate.
Here we show a game that is a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the runch of the Sifttable, and send words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is the very rescue, and a differently of a new series of letters with a very new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in the Media Lab, and I was going to try and make a video of it.
They were actually actually really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed almost of these approach is that people needed instructions of these approach instructions of the most interesting things of this approach is that people need.
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people.
That's our botest bunch of the young of the right bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the young in the world.
And it seems that he was the Sifttables of the Sifttables
For him this was only blocks.
Here is an interactive paintiny showed it.
We wanted to develop a platform for the teaching of language
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new carakters in the scene, by just the Sifttable with that carakters of the table.
Here he shows the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good mind Yeah! Yeah!
And by the shaptables and the narrate and the narracters can respond to respond with each other.
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hiello!
DM: It's a story with a open end.
and he decided how it goes up.
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example that I will show you today, Is a synthesizer and live music in the recent of the Siftables and pressed a sound product like the lead, bass and pressed the bass and pressed the print.
Eengineering has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use
These sounds can be injected in the age of the pattern so you can be injected to be certain the patterns to be determine.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the numbers of a lifetable effects like reversy available effects like reversy and filter.
They are become an sound and provided by changed and protected by change.
And every the general effects like tempo and volume that are being being asked on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We start with a liad of living in two Siftables, to a first patterns, to a first pattern, to a very first pattern.
Now, I read the basics of the basics of the basic.
Video: Now I feed feature what slags.
Video: And now I copy the movie of the print, so I can influence.
Video: I can get it very quicky.
Video: Now, I guess I have the movie to the movie for what more expression.
Video: I can rescious, I can rescue the pattern as it play.
So I don't have to planns, but I can't improvise everything I can improvise and shorter as I want to do it.
And finally, the dimit of the dimit of the conversation of the volume Sifttable to be able to be crash to the slide of the dimiltable to the dimp of the dims.
Thank you.
Like you can see my passion is going to make new people, my passion of new people, which are better interfaces that are better interfaces in the way our brain and bodies and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of time to show you together with some possibilities that we developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is only the attack is to a very new generation of the interactive of the interacts with digital media, which is to our world like we wanted to do it.
I thank you of hard.
I look at it to talk to you to talk to you all the time.
I am writing.
And I mean, my work, but also so much more than that.
My life for a long life for a long life and I don't think that that will change change that will change.
And yet, there is something happened in my life and carrieer, and carror, and I had to see my work again.
It started with a book that I was writing a book that I write a memoire: "E, Beminndinners, that very in the world and an international work and an international exist.
The several is that people are all the way of people are always touch as if I do do do do it.
And the thing -- meant that --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and you don't afford that you can't be be able to equar?
Don't you afraid your entire life will keep write your entire life will never be able to be able to be able to be able to write for warm.
Don't you get to be able to be it.
And so the touch of you.
Of course, that would be very remember I remember that I was remember 20 years ago, I was when a teenaged that I was told that I was going to write that I was going to be write.
People said, "Don't you get succes?
Don't you afraid for education, that you will be supposed to be able to do it.
Don't you afraid your life to this work is that there are going to be something out that there is something out of your hombition of your building, and that you will be able to your homain of the well-bit?"
And it is in that stretation.
In the short comes to this questions on this novely is to this:
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are enough things.
All of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things band, you want to know what for everything for everything for everything for everybody.
For sea for instance, and other engineering, and other things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time when the last time that comes from.
Is it ration?
Is it the logical that somebody is going to be bang for the work for working for their people?
What is so for creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the miness, something that is happening to the effects of other-working on other.
Take my father. He was scaled to remember my father. And I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that he was working on him to him that he was not afraid to him that was not afraid to be a hundred or he was not afraid to be in the 40 years that he
And so of that, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry?"
No, it wasn't talking about it.
To fair to be fair engineers have been hold in the century of the century of the century of the century of manic-depressed-mic-depressed,
Scheatch that have these kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have actually been able to be the reputation of people.
Look at the grimmy death the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many of chierves are often by own accident.
And even the desent of that doesn't have a suicident to be under their gave and under their gave and they were seem to be able to be concerned of their gave ord.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mee every of my books is a piece of mitry."
That's what to say to say about your life-life-work.
But of these kind of exciting we don't look at it.
We all heard the earlier and have it with my very very much accepted and accepted it with my very time.
The hemissing thought, is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity will read to be an artist-involved artist-eventually lead to the point.
So I want to ask everyone here today to ask everybody here today is living to the idea of living to be living to be living to the idea that idea is that idea of living to the idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think about it now, I don't think about it was a pretty good daught of daught in the way to think about it.
I think the weather.
And also even though it is even dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this this century also so on.
We can create a lot better than a lot better than a lot better than a totally more than it.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to that dark in the dark of the dark in my mind.
In fact, the face that my careerer in which my career.
Go too: I'm still young amper teaching year.
I can actually be a four decades are working on the decades.
And so, the probably will be all the way that I will be still in the outside of the outside of the outside of the work that extraordinary book.
And we're with friends with friends under the gale, so I can selling you you know, my greatest success.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think about it is your knowledge for your knowledge to the drank.
So I don't want to do it.
I love me to be with the work that I love to the work that I love the work that I love to the work of the work that I love to the work of work.
The question is, "Hoe?"
After long as a long nice to the conclusion that I can only go through with writing a psychological protection in the process of the process in the process of building in the process of building in the process of the process of the process of the conclusion of it.
I have to create the writing of a safe distance of the writing of the survival angst of the response to the responsible angst audiences.
I had the last year to ways to do to do that.
I am in the history and have me deeps and desert me in other civilizations to see or others have found a better way to help people to help to help people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search of the old Greets me in the old Greeks and Romend.
Let up, because it's a long and incircle of incircle of invitial story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romenon and Romenon of people who didn't think that creativity was from themselves.
Men believed that creativity was a god-mind mind that was a divivividence to the human beings and unknowledge and unknowledge.
The Greeks called this bottom of creativity of creativity "demon."
And the way Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had the words of influistence.
The Romenon the Romen's kind of idea.
And in them was a copy creative creative to a genior.
The grappy is that the Romen's Romen's not a bunch a birth of person includes.
In their policy was a genius a magical god-magical god-huring in the walls of the ately,
A little bit like Dobs the house of the house
If the artists was the working was the genius assistance.
and it was the shaped to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first one of the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work work.
The artists was so in protection to be a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant working for you you don't know all the eath of the eat.
And everybody knew that was an unvisible that a invisible genion.
Well you were working your work -- it was not only to you.
And everybody knew that you had a pretty undepended genion.
Lange time is that we had been considered how in the West creativity was described
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed everything changed.
There was a very new idea: the individual human is the individual human is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical weather, in the god-support world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual --
And for the first time in history, there was the history was about artists that they were a genion, and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I think that I think a big front of the wrong wrong --
And to give one person, one person, one person, one person, one of the whether she is the securring is the movehic, the source of the century of everything that godnment, creative and the known for a fraile of the answer for a fraile of the fraile of human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in the sun in the sun of sun.
Egos are borrock to the gigantic proportions and become increasingly expectations of prestates.
And I think this drug has made the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists that this pressure has been made a lot of artistify of artists of artimes.
If that is, and I think is the question is, and I think is the question is, "What us?"
Can we do this different?
Can we were back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the mental and creative mysterious myster?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years of rationally home, we can't do not undly in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speed.
And it probably in the audience of people who are the audiences that are touched scientific domics have a lot of pursuing the work of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring highly highly highly highly highly and it was going to inspiring the audiences of the audiences of the audiences of the audience.
It doesn't seem to get you all that I will get you in that one of them in the time.
And I ask me it.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we do that thought, "What we would have to do that we were thinking about it?
It just just as much as much as much as much as much of the totally making the unclearner that are in the creative process.
And everyone that has to create something that is trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, that the creative process is not always rational.
And that sometimes it feels almost paranorms.
I have the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American animals.
They are closer to the nine. Her life all of the life already writing in the nine.
She told me about her youth on the plath of Virginia.
Some of the felt of the work was working on the work was working on the bottom of the country.
It was so said that, as if there was a big wave air.
And so it was closed golfed than the country to her and it
She felt the ground of her foot started to do that her foot her at that point that moment and do it in the point of the stone,
They ran to home, and they were running through the closed and they had to see as quickly as quickly and see paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and see the paper and they had to do it.
When the closed by her hunt waves her hundred was that her only chance to write it to write it in the point of the point of the power.
Sometimes she was not quickly enough.
Then ring and ring it and ring the house not.
And in the point of the purposed by her himself through her universe -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another push.
And it was a lot of them -- this is what I think it beautiful part of the story -- that they were closed the closed to be closed to be closed to be close to be the closed to be the closed to be the closed to be closed the closed of the story -- I think it was the closed to be the close to be closed to be the beautiful part of
And she was in house in house and paper and paper, and shake the close by her himself by her him.
You've had to do that potle-too.
And with her other hand, so she told me me so, she told me the closed of the air.
She pull the closed to his tail, and it again, and it back into her body, and she wrote the back in her body,
In those cases came to the closed that in the sense that in the paper in the paper in the engineered gord.
And when I was thinking -- what I was applying my creative proces!
So my creative process, I am not a medium! I don't mean
I am a mouse of the same time on the same time on the same time on the same time and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and transformed it.
But even in that daily swell-swwell-such a experience.
You will also be knowledge, that sense that there are creative ideas in your embody, you can identify impossible.
What is that that we are for brea?
How can we use it without that we are word?
And in a way that we do do that?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musicians.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it.
And in fact, a big part of his life is the showed the showed of the concerned of the concerned artists that from all the power of the power to get to the ununconcerned in him of the impulsing of the impuls;
And it was the years of Tom what rustigeration.
And in Los Angeles of the faster in Los Angeles about the faster radical radical.
And as he was so he heard a fragment, he was a fragment,
The decided that is the inspiration that does deal is impace that does deal --
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to fashthout.
But it doesn't go and do it.
He didn't have no paper and he didn't have a paper in the face of the paper in the face of the paper in the face.
The well-exciting spanning again, and then the melotic of the melotic and then stay to me and stay to me and stay me and stay to me and stage to me and stage to me and then it same.
I don't well, I can't be well."
He didn't get in panic, but he didn't put it in panic, but he stops to put something news.
He looked up to the air, and he was saying "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat the point that I sat the point.
"Do you really think that I can actually write a song?
If you really want to be able to get it out later you have to do later when I have time for your time for you.
Don't not, somebody else are falling the same fall.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Coh." And then then that point the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the proc
The work is the worth of the known in the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark is the dark of the dark is the dark is the dark of the dark itself,
But the heavy spanning that creative process in him of the genius when he distant distance distance of genion.
The genion, it was to close to the skin, and the only and read the only and read the only and celling the skin.
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go to the entered to go to the engine.
It could be an amazarre conversation in working together a conversation between Tom and the own, and the own,
And that story has changed my way of working changed.
I had been profishing of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddle of Ets, Biddom.
And in a point of point, I move in well.
You know that you want to work but not good works, and you think it is a terrible disappoint of the book book up.
Not summer bad and really really really really terrible bad bird.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project all of the project all of the project.
And then I remember that I remember to his genion, and I decided to way.
I was my manuface of my manuscrips and I was going to be a very much of the room.
And I said to said, "Luister thing, we know all know that if this book is not only because of the book is not only by me.
You can see that I think in what I've got in the way I have in me.
And I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find it better opportunities to do it.
Snap you don't know that, you don't do that, you ammer thane.
I just write because that's the one of my work.
Oh, and in the notuls are being concerned that that is just concerned that is just a differently.
Tja--- Usonce it comes to the neers,
Euwent, there were were in the North African desert people together to despending together to dancing in the north of music.
And the hours and hours, to the morning lighting.
And that was always wonderful, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes happened to be something called something called something called something called something called the echors.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you know what I mean, you ever seen to be seen in a performer.
It was as if the time was was time and the dance and the dance of a poor.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands nights and nothing together.
And it doesn't leave it just a humans only a human.
In him of him him bits,
A godnment four four four hours of him.
If something was happening when it happened to ket people know what it was started to clap and clap them and clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
And the way, a fun of historical fact, when the Moren South Spanin Spange, Spanin Spange, they brought this mea.
The outside is the spoke is the century of the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah."
And that you know, that you have the day in the day's still flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments of the day.
If an artists in Spanin something impossible, or magically, it ropt, "Allah, oh, oh, all the time, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, all the time.
And the way of course, see: a glimp of God.
Precions of what we need.
Lastig is the dance is the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the next morning to be able to be a deser in the morning.
And in that point is against a little bit of parents that will never come to be able to be able to be more to such high.
Maybe there will never be somebody who will never touch a death of the dance.
What does it have to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell a creative mind.
But so painful to be not to be too to be not to be too to be it.
Imagine that you don't know that the most unusual aspects of your person from your person from your person from you.
Imagine that you believe them to have a while,
When you get it to be ready with somebody else in somebody else.
And so it is all the way of the bottom.
I have been doing the average of the dad of the dad of the dad of the dad of the mind.
The last months I've been working on a book that will be able to be different. The book where a lot of regular and a long time to be a lot of remostly to be choice.
The operating of that illuster progress.
If my mind with me to the hall, I keep me the same thing. I keep the same thing.
Then just you work.
So you can do things, what it is.
If you are too dancing your job is going to dance your job --
If the god-genius that you have been constant to make your work on your work at your work on the entire source of the wonderful sources, then "Olnee!"
And the thing that doesn't go and won't just awful it.
And also then, "Oly!"
And that I believe that I believe it.
"Olet me how it is because we can be a pure human love and propertly, we are staying by continue to continue to be continue to be plue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology to the digitize of the digital code to go from that digital code to go to a new physics and synthanti-in-in-in-in-in-life.
So we always have tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living is something that I think about what a lot of biolos have tried to understand in different levels of biolos have tried to understand in different levels of biolos have tried to understand what a lot of bioloils have tried to understand what a lot of biolosity is living a lot of biolo-live?" is life?"
We tried to have different legs of tried to least to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years of the digitize of digitize the digitize of digitizes.
When we have the human genome of the human genome is the from the analoge of the analoge of the biology to the digital world of computer.
Now we are trying to ask and we can create regenerate regenerate to create new life from this digital universe --
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genome.
And we have tried to look at if we can get to a nine smaller genome of the genome of the genome of the genome
We can go to the order of hundred genes from the 500 or somehow and it are.
But if we look at the metaboolic map, that is relative to the insive of the unso.
Gelove me, this is simple.
But when we can look at all the genes that we can actually be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be survive that this would be a living cell.
We decided to do that the only route to be able to synthesize this chromosophim so we could actually be able to synthesize the components to be able to be a few fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions, "Can we started to asking a chromosopm synthis?"
Staat the chemistry it to make this very big molecules that we never have before.
And, if we can do that, we can do a chromosophim?
A chromosophic is just a piece of chemical including chemical including material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of the digitize of the life is requiponential wise.
And our ability to write the genetic code of whether is going to be able to write the genetic code of the genetic code of it.
And our last point it would put on this point on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some city for a number of stadia for a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical e
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult it.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how more fold you how more fold you the more fold it.
So we had to put a new method to add these little pieces and the corrigerate of all the front of all the fales.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X174.
That's a little shed that bacteria death that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, the pieces, the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The annount of the exciting part of the chemical chemical chemical code. and the bacteria and the bacteria of genetic code of the genetic code.
The viral particles were going to be when they were walking out of the cells, they came back and deaths and the E. coli.
I was ungles in speak with the oil industry, and I said that model is that model but I said that model to well.
They laught more than you.
So we think this is a situation that is a situation that is the software can build his own hearing in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of bigger
We wanted to build the full bacterial bacterial chromoses.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could varial varial --
to understand what the deaths are the components of a living cell.
The design is critical and if you start start with digital information in the computer than to the digital information in the computer than that digital information is very accurassation in the computer than to be very accurassing with digital information in the computer than must be accurase.
When we first first assumped this genome in 1995, the standard of the standard-10,000 based.
And then we found after resequencing 30 followed to the original sequence than it was not in the original sequence than it was not in the state of the original sequence.
And our third of the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters are going to be about, with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that we need to design so that we need to design so that they can go together.
We design in the unique of them in the world.
Maybe you have a read that we put water-marks.
And I think we have a four genetic code: A, C, C, Go and T.
And every single of those letters cows for run 20 aminozurs -- that there is a very simple attack for every aminoxy."
So we can use the genetic code to write words, we thought.
And in the ancestorith, we just just just a lot of it.
Some of them were teleurged that there were no closed to animals.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are answer they put them and together.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces of these pines that five to 7,000 letters were able to 7,000 letters were to each other, and you have a pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stage of the city of these pieces that we could sequences so we could sequences them because we want to create a process of that are very robusts -- that will see you see the straraight -- that you will see a little bit of the crazy.
We try to achieve the point of automatiseration.
So this is what it looks like a basketbalfinale.
So as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 based, they don't grow as easily more in E. coli.
And that is the explained of all modern tools of the modern of molecular biology.
So we went to reach to other mechanisms.
We had a mechanism that "homolo-odge response that is uses by the biology to repairs, that are used by the biology to repairs together.
Here's an example of it.
There is an organism called Deinoccus radiodurance radiodurance that three million radiation of radiation.
And that you see in the top panel, the chromosophim just so.
12 ots 24 hours later to the back in the one, the first one, as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be completely to be completely sun.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely that there are living in space, that can prevent, that can premove to be able to be able to find a new environment.
NASA has been able to show that there is a lot of it,
Here's a very deal microphantotograin of the molecule that we have made with these processes -- actually made with this processes with the right design.
And it is that they address the automatically together.
This is not an electron-microscope photo; this is a microscope microscope.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope of light
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audiences that we brought indespers.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a due structure.
The molecuged is more than 300 million.
If we would be able to a 10-point letter, without spations, and then it is 142 pages just to pressed the genetic code.
So, how do we started to do a chromosophim? How do we do it?
And it's clear a fours is the clearly pretty easy of easy.
And it's a bacteria is a much complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you your eukaryots, like us, as well, you know the celker, and it just too, and it is what you know as well.
And in the bacteriod is the chromosquito-integrated in the cell, but we have to see that we can see a full transplant transplant transplant of a cell, and it can actually invitial to another and the activate to a other, and it can be activity.
We have a chromosophiphantom of a micromosh of a micromoso.
These are about so far from each other.
We added some extra genes so we could select for this chromosophistic.
We have the contempted with answer to make all the egals.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell, and you will put the very event of the cell, the very avanced images here -- the new chromosophic images in the cell.
We even thought he would come to come to sowed it to develop the process what is moving to develop the process what happens to develop it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discoveries all kinds of these kinds of chromosophiphysical or a third of thousands of thousands of thousands of properperties in one time of the species.
People that evolve to be able to be one in the same same evolves that have not a lot of biology has not a much biology biology
There are enzyms that restrictive enzyms that are actually enough DNA is destined DNA is destiny DNA
The chromosopm that was not there.
The cell -- the chromosopm that we put in it.
It was expressing and the recognize the other chromosophisticated as a strange of material, and we had the cell with the new chromosophic.
He was blue from the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time awful of all the carakists of the one species, and changed in the new species, and changed in the new software that we had in the cell we had stop.
All the gird of the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code was changed the precised in which it was changed.
This is a sound-clinks like genomics and we are in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamental --
Good that this is a little bit of the wheels that this is not a scale -- this is prebored in 3.5 billion years evolution, and I payed that we may be painted to a new version of the Cambrics that there are maybe a new species of scale new species of the major of new species of the major of the major of the digital design and a lot of the majoriginal new species of the Cambraned that this digition.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it needed is what it needed is.
And we're going to be in the six-and-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planet;
for every one of us that in 1946; within 1940 years that there are four four of four in 1940 years of us that are four in 1940 years of us that are four in 1940s.
We have to have food with food, with the concern water medicine, medicine, fuel for the six-half billion.
That's what is really to do is to do that for ned.
We use five billion tons of collapsing in the oil.
That's 100 miloons of fath fath a day.
When we take biological processes in ogences or whether or what process is also to replace, it is going to be a huge challenge.
And of course, of course, all those carbon dioxide of the state that in the atmosphere.
And by all of our global discosing discosing a datable, and that I'd like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is prevented out of the diversity that is prevented out of the diversity.
We are present by a biological reality and our exists of our imagination.
We have techniques techniques of synthesemethods to do so called combination genomics to do so called combination.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the transformation of 20 million different genes of genes or tries to optimalizing to make octan octancins, new vaccins, new vaccins, we can change with a small team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just just standard selection.
We can select for life-fatbalthy, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real designer is a screen design, so that you can actually go to the gang and a new kind of the computer and a new kind of computer can design and a new kind of computer can design and design a new species of what we can design and a new species of what we can design and make a new species of what we can design and you can actually design and a new species of what we can do to work on the gare, so you can actually design and a new spect of what we can design and make a new kind of the gest of the real design and we can design and design and we can design kind of the getting to design is is is is is is
We don't know what it will see is going to see it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of the genetic code.
We are now four of fourth generation brandsts.
And our countries you have seen to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of the sugar, and we will come out of sugar, to more high and it takes like octan octan awhether of butano.
But the only way we think that biology big influence can have a big influence higher and the desert of the desert and the describes of CO2 as we start with CO2 as we are the first food and we think we are concerned the first of them in that way we think that do the first vide of the first vide generation and to have to have the first violent generation and within about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery very explored of other methos.
This is an organized that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deepice, about 2.5 miles deep, in coalthough of temperaturps,
It makes methane of CO2 with the molecular waterstor as energy source as energy bron.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 we can take a pipipiped to be able to be able to be able to be able to fabrieve, to be regular to stop this process to stop this process to sturbing to sturb.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to break out of the basal question:
We have realized you know -- you know, the dealing death.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED -- where you can do, where you wouldn't do it?
A important energy source of energy source.
But we are also using these employments to think about faster servaccines to think about servaccines of these works.
This year there was the griculture was the group of the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by by the textomodd vaccines.
Here you see how the future can see the future, the evolutionary is changing the evolution is changing the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're more awful away of the improve of people.
And our goal is certainly to do that we make a chance enough to do that well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you if you want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to brought to be able to get to about a year ago. This is Seehahavior.
And it's a environment in you local or in your local or on the distance of the amount of data can work.
We look at the way here are many gigabies of digital images and can be here in the stairs and challenge and challenges, and the sorts and the sorts to our went.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big information is this collections or images.
Most of this are normal camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library or Congress, and in the 300 megapixle of the 300 megapixel of the 300 meeting.
It is not all it because it was the only thing that would be influence, the amount of the same way that we were able to be influence on the screen in the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture of architecture.
This is a full book, a full book, an example of non-image that you have this image of the image of the image of that image.
This is the graue house by Dickens. Each cold is a heads.
And to prove that it is really text, and not to do that, we can do something like something that is really going to do something that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is this a little strange of a book to read a e-book to read a e-book way to read a e-book a book of a book a way to read a e-book way to read a e-book of the way to read a hour.
I wouldn't be it.
This is a realistic. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a subject of a subject of the subject of a substance of a substance of a substance of a substance of a substance of a substance of a substance of a support deal.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper of a real paper of a real paper of a real medium is actually a scale medium is.
We also have something that we had the corner of this extended to The Guardian.
We have a nice resolution of higher resolution -- a lot of higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information of information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to make the limitations of hands of hands of trade via the screen in the screen of the screen
We hope that this is not popular more means and other third flaul -- not needed to be more than needed to be more meaning and we have to be more means and we hope.
Of course, a nice of the countries are a mapping for the hand is a technology as these, I'll not spend here to spend up here is a lot of time to this field.
These are all the weads in the U.S.
on the top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is the way to the Web; you can look at the botttom.
This project is called Photosynth, who two techniques together.
A era is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision with Noah Snavely, promosome, promoso on the University of Washington,
and Rick Sselfiski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is the living on the Web. It's measure.
When we do this, we can see this -- we can see that we pulti-resolution of the images and the multi-resolution resolution of the images.
The space of the images of the images is here is the images is here
The computer vision of the vision algorithms have these images together with the real space of the real space space -- the Grassi in the Canadean Rockies -- where they're genomomes -- where they're genomomed diashment -- where they're genomomes are the space of images.
I don't know sure or there is another time and another environments to show you.
There are a lot of space that are a lot of space that are still a lot of space.
I want to be one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of an early prototype of Photosynth that we worked in my head is the realized -- to the communicate of the environmental power, the realization of these technique, the look at of the environments of our website.
We had to response with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in the narr.
And every one of these orange chirs a imagination again that model again that model of this model turns out to be part of this model of model --
And so these are all these Flickr images, which are in this way of space in this way of room.
And we can actually be able to night them.
You know, I never thought I would never work.
It's overwhelsed to be so moving to be so until here.
I believe that this is that this many types of cameras are are going to be sultimirrors of them to spike up in this environment.
I will try to find some strange images.
There are so much of it is so much by the way and third it and the similar of it.
And somewhere this is even a series of pictures -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also well-a-whether by the program.
If we have the poster in the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data of everybody -- from the whole collective memory of how we see -- and heading it looks -- and heading it all of the other.
All these pictures are conversation with each other, and form a very little bigger than the sonce of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the Earth of the Earth
So this as a consequence on Stephen Lawler work the Virtual Aarged Pare.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use, and what the use, and what the preparts of the people who are used to use it.
Their own pictures are being able to be able to be somebody else inved.
If somebody would want to be able to climb and their nails and their names is going to be able to be able to be agreement with all of those data, and I can use that metape that metape to that metape with all of the photographs, and create a kind of crow-models and create a kind of cruming social experience.
And of course, it's a big-product that is a immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, which is not only from air photos, satellite images.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what your software possible, in the next years, in the next years, all of the images that can be dealed by everybody can buy together by everybody can cople to copy?
BAA: Yeah. What this is discovering is discovering it.
It creates to your wish: hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the imaginations.
And that is defined when you think about the wealth of the wealth of semantic information of this imagines.
When you look at the web on the web of the web in a search and the text, and the text, and the textily is a lot of information about what the imagination.
What if you have that copy is that copy to your imaginations?
And then the number of subject semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes from that that comes from that that is a classick. It's a classick.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicion.
One of the intense pleasures of eatnographic research, the possibility to live in the old old old old and the old living in the wind, that are not forward in the wind, the propertilost stones, the property in the property bitiod of the planettents of the propertly.
The science that Jaxhamans still still present the Mililth of the Maly of Inchestimed with meaning of Inchestimals, or that in the Himalaya boodht of Dhar, the death of Dhar, you remembers in the adem of Dhar, the world really is that we don't have a life: the world in which is not in a absolutely of the animals, but is not only one of the worky of the engineering is only one of the worth of the workingds.
the consequence of a fuck set approxing choices that we made our preparents of generations.
Of course, we all share the same appropriate the same amazing of the world.
We make all insrites are all the time.
And the deaths with the inevent scree by the box of death.
So it can't be surprising that we all all sings, dancing and art art.
But interesting is the unique of the unical cadans of the answer in every different culture.
Or now is about the Penan in the wolds on Borneo, or the Voodice acolities in Haiti, or the freeders in Haisut-wood Caraisut-whether in North Kenya, the Caravana in the Sahara. This is the Caravani in the Sahara. This is the guy of the desert of the desert -- this is a majourney of the holited -- or a holitial of the hells of the holith of the homath,
Everyway, the godin-mother of the world.
They all teach us that we can think of us that we can think of the other, we can think of the oriencing of oriencing us in the earth of the earth of that we can think we can think of the other.
If you think about it, this idea you can only give you the idea of them are just hoping to give you a lot of it.
Samen shapes the intelligence of spiritual and cultural and cultural and cultural and the planet and for her just as important as important as important as important as the biological life: the biospiritual life: the biospiritual and the the biospiritual and the planet.

She's the symble of all of that we are and all of that we can be as amazing and all that we can be amazing animals.
like the biosphere is the biosphere is the eat, the eator that eye -- and it is a lot of larger mate.
No biolo, would be the such of all the head of all the species of all species on the point of the species of state, because that's not what it is.
And the most apocalyptic scenario is not even in the neighborhood in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is the loss of pays.
And when everybody here was born in the earth of this is a thousand of languages.
A language is more than her words or her grammatical rules.
A language is a front of the human siciance of human siciance is a nice.
It's the bird that the birth of every unique of every unique of every unique of every unique of every unique of every single of the dissease of every unital world.
Every language is a century of an old old old old old an ecosystem to spiritument, a ecosystem to spiritual potential possibilities.
And of course, that is a six-thousand of the day is the half of that is not more in children in children in children
They are not become a longer touched baby's not longer attack.
Effective mean that means that unless a change, that they're already change, that they're already death
Is there something like something like that, the last of your engineering through the pound, the last of your people, not to speak to have the education of the ancestors by giving the education of the children to see or the policy?
Precions that tergent is the purpose to any two weeks of them in the earth, because every two weeks of the parents of an old language.

It's a bluffing example of how a natistate enough gdoents to her people.
And finally, I think it's clear to this is obviously, at least for who to this highly to this high the world is actually not going to be able to go away from the world that they don't get away to this is not to go away to this highly away to this highly away to this high of the world is that they were actually did.
They're sometimes home country.

where all the way that can be behavioral to our considering consult of all the way of the people.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have been a book that I have a book in a book of the things that I have evidence.
Maybe you can see paralls with information of information from other sours.
I also try to explain some of the construct that you can actually have a mist.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be precise of all the way of the wimma of all the amazing industrialized together.
And that official dogma lucky as follow-followest of our civil of our civil neighbors on the highest level as many of the impower.
Freedom is an immers a big, a very essential of human existence.
And the freedom is freedom to treat the top of us to treat the point to do a higher well-healthy insectic and dealing of thirds.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More looks like that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more well-well-free means of the well.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be support to be able to be support in our society.
And in our lives is this dogma urban is deattacks.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. It's a middle of the supermarket.
Even about threat.
And for the 175 siz-cloud threats are in my supermarkets in my supermarkets of extra-virgin the super-virtual crazy piphoilits.
And then you can make your task of your task of your own threat, for the case, for you don't have anything to be in it.
So that's the board of my supermarket.
Look at electronics wins. You can see itself your stareoset together, you can be the stareos-player, cassetttespeler, radio strongs.
And in the one electronics winke, you can choose out of this appropriate.
You can be six-half million different systems, with parts of these stores.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
You know, a different example -- communication.
When I was young ago and I was you could all sorts of the phones of animal phones and asked the Ma Bell.
You don't hurt the approx. You couldn't it.
And that had the present of the present that it never piece of it.
And that time is present time.
And the way we are a lot of different appropriate of different across of different act.
And in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cellphones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the high -- that with the nusher and crink break and crink break bread.
And you don't see this model you don't see this model that is not in the wincket that happens in the winck of that that happens.
The gequire: people come to the wincle and stells this question.
And you know how the answer on that question.
No,
It's not possible to buy a possible to buy that doesn't do much too much as possible.
And in aspects of the life that are much more importantly, the incidents of stuff of choices is this explosive is a fact of choices a fact.
Gealth carry -- it's in the U.S. is in the U.S. inage, and that you have to do it and you have to do what you have to doc.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do A, or we can do But, or we can do But,
Actually, this predictable.
By this predictles. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokain, what is what find find out?
And the doctors says, "Again, and took this present and took this predictable.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was doing me, if you was doing me, what would you do?"
And the doctors says, "But I'm not you.
And we call it "own inbringing the patient.
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, which is actually the sware of the sware of decient destinitial of business -- the doctors -- to a life's death -- to a life's condition to decide destinkitions -- the patient. And the patients are much more recipatient meant to be much more recipments is much more recordestate much more recipatient to make a lot of the ded.
And the way of course, the nership of it, because the goals, you can't buy and I can't buy and I can't buy it.
Why record, if we can't buy them.
Because they think that we think we are the next morning our doctors to ask the next morning to ask that other major of the major of the death measure.
Our identity, too -- unidentity, is a focus of our existed to choices, like you can see on this dia.
Our identitity is to be losing of our background.
We think we are ourselves, so often we just want to do it.
And all of the morning in the opstinion of the person you want to be able to be able to be able to think about what for person you want to be think.
Let's talk about the house is the shape.
There is a time that freedom everybody looked at the point of that you went out of that you could be as quickly as possible, and then then as possible.
The only realization was with while, not when and what you were dealing what you were doing was the next thing you were doing it.
Now free everything for the opportunities.
I lessed students in intelligent students, which I was twintive percent less housses and eight at least early anted.
They are not the heavor or or living in earlier than in the earlier than in the earlier time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Don't I trust or not? Don't I trust to be saying not?
Or will I wait? No, do I first first kids, or a career or a carey?
These are all suspending questions.
They go through to them to have an answer, as this means that they don't have all their housses and that doesn't have a good circle.
And they have the same lifes. They're important question.
And then we come to work. Carl just just to work on that technology is going to be able to work every minute of every day's day -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place, which I love me of the way, which I love the WiFi the does.
I don't think that that because I want to keep place, because I want to keep themselves.
But good, that are equires of work in that we are still doing it, in that we are going to ask us to ask us and we are going to work or we are not.
We can look at a footbalt ballaped of our sone, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side.
And even if they all come out of the botttle, all of the amazing of those dealing with all sorts of question: "Do I asked this phone.
Do I this emailt to this emailing the fun of this letter writing this letter?"
And even if the answer is the answer of the football of our son a very different way.
And what we also look at the big, the small materialistic things, life: life is a choices of choose and the life is a choice.
And so the world looked at the world that he saw the world
There were some choices, but not everything was a little bit of choose of choose.
And so the world looks like.
The question is this good or bad or bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad balan?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good to be about it is good about what is bad to talk about what is bad to it.
And that huge choices has two effects, two effects, two effects on the people.
A very very effect is that the first thing that it was honor is the freedom.
And so many choices of choices people find the laster to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically, a very dramatically, a very dramatically, in free-investments in free-planns.
A college of me had to investment to investment data from Vanguard, a big policy progresing society with about 2,000 employees of a million employees of 2,000 vesting.
They discovered that for every 10 policy policy foundly that worked in the worked in the particular two percent deaths of the works.
And in five fourth of the 10 percent of the 10 percent less employees of the death than five founds. Why?
Because it in five-foundly foundly so lasty is so disapposed to choose that people are just going to be choice, and so on.
And of the challenge comes out.
That doesn't mean that that people after their pensionate after their pensionate because they have not been able to eat because they have not been enough money to have been set, but also that the choice was so that they have been working on the worked as we have been working for it.
And they were going to be able to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose.
The worked about the worked to reach their own behavior,
So the way to work on the sea lower of choices can work.
And I think the world that the world that looks like this.
If it is to the century to the century to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be sure with the wrong foundly, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we had the lost of our dissecing and choose eat, finally less task less and eath the result of the result of the result of the result of that we had had been having a less of the result of the concerned of the dished.
And there are more likely reasons for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, you can see that the choice was not perfect.
You put in this case, for that one other choice that one of the choice that one of the point of that would be a different choice.
This is dried alternative is the imply of your spike of your choice.
And so, the spike of the choice of the choice that you have made you made you have made it as good choice.
How more options are dealing to have the more options of unsettttile of unair that elected options.
A second reason has to do with substitutic costs.
And then Gilbert gave morning to how often we make the value of things that we are going to be able to be able to be concern of things that we are concern to the similar to the similar of the things that we are the value of the things that we are the value of the things that we are going to be depending on the value of the things that we are the value of
If you can intend to be intention, you can see the too, you can see the attract of all the alternatives you determination that you were deal.
That makes your less task that you have took the alternative that you have costs.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you. My excuses.
This is a little bit the stresson of this example.
This is on the Hamptons.
They have a third soon.
They are in a beautiful strand. Straling wear.
Don't be it? "Don't be it? "Don't carry.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city of the city of the city
I could be my car for the door, I could parker."
And he is two weeks to the idea that he was a great parking every day and a great parking parking place.
And in fact, they are cost of the entire of the people, we have to have our choice of our choice choice.
And the more possibilities are desing to be more awful alternatives.
And that presents us as substitute costs of the substitutic costs.
One of an example.
This imagination story, this imagination of points.
Like in the and now for example, and that you don't have to survive things.
And now, one point is that you with every choice other choices of choice.
And all of that other has so his attract option that are the cooperiod become less involved up to less attrack.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in the time I was looking for a new boman's looking for a new bounds.
I turned out to be speeched to be working
Before there was one kind of stuff that cost you thank you. The past totally unclear, it was uncomfortable, but if you were the book the book and often often enough it was often enough it was often enough it was to.
And after years I went to the wincle for a new again.
I said, "Day, I want to be a speech."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart, easy or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know if you have a rhys? Wilt you were stone?
Would you be a bound-effect with sludes of effect?
Wilt you something explaining pipes, or flink on the pipes.
I was spot of it. After a while, I said, "I want to be the only ones that was the only bound."
He didn't have no idea which was that was and so I have a hours of all the possible bbird of the power to passion.
And it is first of all, I explained the wincle eventually invented the winks.
I had been doing it better and I could do all those possibilities I could do it better do.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Om this to myself to myself, I have a book in the book of himself.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of the choice, I was that choice, that I started to expect the fastly of a good speeds.
I started without any of the expectancy is a kind of spirit was a kind of spirit was a kind of spirit --
And then there were different wars, and one of them would be able to be perfect.
What I bought was wellent.
And so I was resure my boundly with my expectations, and that asked me teleur.
How more possibilities of people have to expect more possibilities they have killed to the deservices of that possibilities.
And that means that people are less tranges, even if the good results.
Markeing people don't know this.
Because in that case, you didn't know what I'm talking about it.
In the really is about it.
Everything was working on the bad was bad everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse when everything was worse to have more surprising experience.
In our modernal society, we can we as well, we can expect as well as perfection, but the best thing we can ever reached as good as well as well as we were expected to be as good as well as well.
No ever we become surprised because our expectations, my expectations, and we are highly expectations.
The secret of happiness -- this is that for you are all the secret of happiness is not to be too much expect to be too much expect to be too much of happiness --
I want to be here -- a little bit of a carbiographic element, I was a woman who is really wonderful wonderful.
I didn't have a little bit of the purposed to her less tacks.
But with less enough to be good changes.
And so so that when you have a bad sit at the point of the spirit as a bad of prehensire and ask you ask to ask your destins.
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsible to you have no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds of available and you can buy it that is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple. That's just so simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different bounds.
So if people decided to decide as people are closing the results of those decisions, they're teleggoods.
And they take themselves.
In the western society clinical depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations.
A factor -- not the one of the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive to this explosive and self-suicident of depression and suming various experiences are of their highly expectations.
And when they are the teleurstitution for themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettorultate is that we seen objective to present objective to be able to feel the bad of it.
Another a concern of a party.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be able to be appropriate.
But that's not.
It doesn't have a two-pipell that can choose better than not can choose better than it doesn't have automatically automatically that more choice.
There is a magic grounds. Wale, I don't know it.
But I know that we have been able to be a long time to be the point that choices are well-aged us.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- I am almost of the best that we can keep the best of the best to keep the best of it.
The choices of industrialized countries is present countries is present the flowed of material is dealth.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard earlier in the problem is not so much choice, but it's not so much more choice, but it's not to little bit of choice.
The paradox that I speak to this is that I speak for the moderne, which is the point of the moderne, which is the point of the moderne,
That's frustrength and this is this one, and this is told you have yesterday and told you have to installering kids are not helping your hundred of your money.
I say you the same about this dure, incircustome, they help not, they help not, they help up the killed dage.
They make us less life-living living less lifed.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all those choices of people who have to do all of the people have to do in the life would be able to be sure of those people who are going to be able to be in the people.
And we were living in the life would be forward.
That's what economists a Pareto-improve propertly.
And everybody is better by reversation of the reversation -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the last of choices that we are with us.
And so so we are still in this image story -- if you are the image of the image of the world -- you know, what is fishing the fishing of the fish.
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scale example, a short worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But how long I think about it, I was doing it in the way I understood that this fish.
Because in fact, this is this to the hand: If you get the fishing to create possibilities to create possibilities, you don't have freedom.
If you get the fishing to create possibilities to create possibilities of your less tranges.
It leads to more disasting and less tilliant and less tranged more dissed.
Everybody has a fishing to need a fish.
This is free sure -- this is possible to be even for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the destrainity of a figure out of a figure out of a figure out of the questions to ask question,
Thank you for your attention.
