Last year, I showed these two dias, to show that the Poice capture, which had about the past three million years of the size of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the several problem because it doesn't show the third of this particular problem because it doesn't show the disk.
The ice capture of the North Pole is in a sense is in a sense of our global climate system.
It turns out it into the swinger and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I show is a speeched version of what's happened the last 25 years happened in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is dungested in red.
Like you see it out of dark blue.
That's the year ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in summer there.
The so-called permanent, five years or older, is almost like blood, which is almost like blood, that is sicpull here.
In 25 years of this to this stuff to this up.
And that's a problem because the frozen fresh, because the frozen Icelerating and there's a very big amount of frozen fretty frozen carbon is frozen carbon is that when it diagraph, if it disease.
Consider the number of disconnect in the atmosphere, that could double that could double that can double the amount of dishes if we describe the surrounds.
In some of the undeep in Alaska signrels to all of the water.
Again, the Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to improvide
Why! She's OK. The question is the question is the question is to be that we will be able to be that
A reason for that, is that this huge "warm-break Greenland from the north of Greenland from the north of the north of the north.
This is a melt two.
The water volume is the waterk volume bigger than it is the bigger than it is the bigger than it was a bigger than it is the bigger than it
This is the Kanger-suather Greiver in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea speats is because it landijes the landics is the place where it comes in the sea.
These floods are taking flight.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, the biggest ice mass on Earth.
And the last months of reported scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole is in the West in the West in the Wain south of meltillands.
The whole continent is for six feet of sea set stying, just like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two of largest ice ice ice mass, are now new now, who were still glaciers were still glaciers --
40 percent of the world population is gets half of his drinking water of that melt.
In the Anthis: this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more strabs.
But when they disappears are also disappears drinking water.
In California was a 40 percent in the snowe of 40 percent in the snowe of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are severe severe.
This global dreams of drought has led to a dramatic rise of forest fuels.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never see in the world has never seen speed.
Four times in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the foreded 75 years.
This pattern is completely untable.
If you look at it from a historic context of a historic context of what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 device every 24 hours,
25 miles in our oceans every day in our oceans, look at the east area of the Stille Ocean, and on every sille side, and on every sille side, and on every silliant continent, there's a drastic dalation.
The only big causes of the Earth, is the only big deforest -- which is for 20 percent of money, which is the amazing of fossil fuels.
Oi, the whole biggest problem, and it's the most biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest of the biggest China.
And there was a lot of coal-making centrales.
But we see a bommacting.
These are the coal-carbon that the building biting became annuated in the last years and green alternatives were proposed to be asked in the last years and green alternatives were read.
There is a political fighting on the road of our country.
The coal coal and oil industone carbon and oil industrial 250 million dollars to promote "clean emergency crossing.
And that picture was a thinking about something like this.
And the urbs of the home in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons of gallons of creatures bel.
You probably see it in the news of the news of the news
This is the one of the biggest dishes in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooking on the level of the Kerstront of the Kerstest was this:
Frosty of "Frosty the cobbbby, is a key up, embedded guy.
He is overliquid to the America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the cotbbbbbbbby-carbon
He is affordable and employees their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia in West Virginia froming.
The biggest mines of the country is the big boss of Massey Cole.

Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate,
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Video "BeCOALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why it's why it's why it's the main goal is to give a giant concern of advertising for the light to the light and bring the light and the regular carbon carbon carbon
Facy, is not smarry.
We find that the clean is -- and it still cooper.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
Let me talk about it.
Video: Actor coal, you have heard a lot of heard.
So let's take a look at this hyper-modern clean coal-coal-coals.
Fantastic! The machines are making pretty much lowing.
But that's the sound of clean coal-coal technology.
Despite the fact that the breaking of coal one of the most important causes of the main causes of the Earth is shape the remarkable of technology that you see here.
Look at the same time, this is the clean coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Eventually pitched the positive alternative of our economic challenges and that region national security.
Video: Stem: Imagine in crisis, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red red of all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuels, like dirty collapsed oils and imported oil.
But now there's a during new solution to get out of it.
And far America of 100 percent clean electricity, inside 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to work on the way to get a plan that makes us more safer and the global warming of the Earth is to.
And eventually a solution that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Intdeal of the Repower America.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Itâ€™s over again, it's about to give America
One of the fastest ways to make an end, to our end dependence of old old and sheep our planet to help our planet to help the planet to help the planet to help the so.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
The follow investments to create jobs.
Voicepower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speaking word that says, "If you want to be fast quickly --
If you want to go far up."
We have to go far away and quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So I'm here to those of you who don't get on: The LHC is the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever underneath 27 miles in the end.
It has to be the conditions that were attack of that were attack than a billions of second after the universe started to be 600 million times a second after the universe started to 600 million times a second of a second as as it started to 600 million times a second of it.
Enorm ambitious, thus!
This is the machine underneath Genee.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one where I'm working with the ATLAS detectors detector -- 44 meter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectarget of ATLAS in ATLAS in connection so you can see the scale.
And at 10 seple last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture picture was taken by ATLAS.
That causes a fetished in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle jail that was all around the way around the LHC and put up with a piece of the LHC, which is bone-bone book with a piece of the LHC, who were flowed in the detector of flows in the detect of the LHC.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September the machine works, we knew that the machine is a huge over.
I don't know whether this the biggest apply or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page of it.
That means we have made a cultural as a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact
And a week later we had a problem with the machine, which was doing with these golden behaviors.
And those bears of 13 thousand of ampeering when the machine on the whole power.
The engineers below you will say, "It's not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they are super-a-superatures on the low-temperature --
So on minus 271 grades, colder than the space between the stars, that can be flowed down the behaviors that are did.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive false in the LHC, was a constructive in the LHC, was a constructive.
And it was the wire was something like this, and was an electric resistance against that 13 thousand of ampeers.
This was the result.
This is another impressive if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons away, and they were mostly moved about 30 inches in the way.
We damaged to make about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did.
We all have distinctioned them.
Now they are back on the way.
Ed map the LHC again, the LHC again.
We will put it back back again, and we expect measures in June or right so we can go on and figure out what the building stone of the universe.
Now, of course, those unhappiness, they have start accidentally, again, the value of scientific research of scientific research of scientific research
I think it's the fact that it's so hard to be so hard to go on than it beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I let the last words on the English scientist-Humphrey Davy, wherever I was disophisticated experiments of his students are students of his students, his students are said, "Nondly, is this is so dangerous for the progress of human mind to the progress of human mind to progress of scientistate that there are not a mysteriod, that there are no new world."
Thank you very much.
I would want to start asking you to ask you to ask to your children's wherever you played blocks.
And when you discovered how to grab it up, and they picked up and consciousness by the way to solve the problems of teaching and hanting hanging through the and hanging of space relationships and hanging from space relationships and hands of space relationships to solve the way to deal with the way you can actually solve it.
Ruimtely insight is very powerful to understand the world to understand the world around us.
If an information inspired by the physical interaction of physical interaction with objects -- and my flapping with my adviser Pattion and my employee and my employee, I started asking to ask -- what if we would use a computer to ask -- what if we would have a computer of ancient and won a kind of digital finger that moves on a plate degraphics of information that we can degrade with both of information that we can degragragragragragragragragragragragragragragrabbed with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with bodiss,
and can ordering the way we want to do that?
And this question help, that we decided to find an answer answer, by building Siftables.
Sort together is a Siftable computer is an interactive computer in a size of a cotttable computer in the size of a cottable computer in the size of a cooky.
They can be movement with the hand, they can provide each other, their movement and they contain a screen and they contain a screen and wireless contact of the display and wireless of the hand,
The nuclear understanding is the physical action, just like blocks can they get moved through it.
And so, the Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem for manipulation of digital information.
And this is that these helping tools are more physical differently. And even of their movement and even of the way we move them and even of the way we move them are different new and fun interactions of trying to discover them.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instony to tell a video that is playing by the offices and others' others and otherso, others playing others:
These interactive portraits are consciously.
If you put together, they will be put together, they will be interest for each other.
If they get surround, they can also get this and can be able to be single this and become a nervous
And they feel movement and crasheting.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting result of this interaction, the use of everyday is the use of the interaction, as it expush of a color as it was a liquid of a color as it was a liquid of color as it was a liquid of color as it was a liquid of the interaction of this interact,
In this example three Siftables of emmers for and I can use them to go up color in a emmerge and I can use them to go up color in a employed in a emmerged.
If we have exercise to the little bit of the back.
There are some of the city for education, and mathematical play ggaminly played with language, mathematics and logic that we want to give people the opportunity to see the result immediately and the result of immediately.
So here I show this is the development of a Fibonacci acci acci acci acci acci acci programmmmate.
And we show a game that a game is between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single around a random letter on every Siftle, and and, you know, form words are being controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is it's really rescued and appears a new series of letters with examples of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I'm going to have to get them out of the Media Lab, and I have a video of it.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed almost not need instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Most word and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people test the test of the test thing.
That's our youngest ber breeding towards the right bottster, right?
And it turns out he just the Siftables left to stack it.
For him these were only blocks.
Here is a interactive paintings of a painting.
We wanted to have a platform for learning to develop language.
This is Felix that demo.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftluence with that characters with that character of the table.
Here he leaves the sun emerged.
Video: The sun is coming up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene
Video: The orange tractor.
Good god! Yeah!
And by Sifta of Siftables and the needle to put the characters with each other, he can responce the characters with each other, Wah, woode!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it goes up.
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example I will show you today show Is a synthesizer and live music child strugggle that we developed have recently-bass and produce a sound produces a sound and drum.
Of course, four different variations, where you can choose what you want.
These sounds can be injected in the art that you can be injected so you can determine the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way, from a life-Siftluence effects like reverb and filter.
They're being added to a sound and adapted and adapted by the offices.
And if you have the general effects like tempo and volume that are added on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We start to start a living in two Siftoot in two Siftoot -- to a first pattern, a first pattern,
Now, I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now, I'm now foot what becomes a little bit.
Video: And now I cope the filter of the drums, so I can affect the effect live the effect live the effect live in the effect lives.
Video: I can accelerating it by the offices of the botttmpo blocks.
Video: DM: Desple I cope the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can reach the pattern as it is playing it is playing the pattern as it is playing it.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything and I can improvise and shorter like I want.
And at the end of the dims of the dims of the volume Siftable to both the left.
Thank you.
Like you can see my passion is going to make new people from creating new people in the way our brain in interfaces that are dested in the way our brains and bodies and bodies and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this designers, and we have a few opportunities that we develop in the lab that we develop in the lab that we developed in the lab
The idea that I want to bring about is that this is just the attend to a whole new generation of aid resources for interacting with digital media that information to our world as we want.
Thank you.
I look at it out to you all of you all of you know.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also writing is so much more than that.
My whole life for a long life for a long life, and I don't think that will change it.
And yet, there's something happened in my life and career is happening in my life and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and re-in-in-in-in-stant across is something that I had to reinclude in my life and career is happened in my life and career is happened in
It began with a book that I wrote recently writing a memoire: "E, Beminnera that very very contrast to my early work all over the world went on and an international exist.
The consequence is that people now have to be everywhere, and always told me as if I do I do do in the way --
And I think -- -- does do it!
People come to me and ask to me and ask ask "Are you going to have never equared that success,
Don't you get your whole life will continue to keep your whole life will be going to be published a book that people will walk for warm.
Don't you get afraid of it?"
And concluded, you know.
Of course, that would be very very of, but I remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, when I was a teenager, if I told him I wanted to be a teenager.
People said, "Don't you get success, you don't get succes?
Don't you get afraid you going to be on to be supposed to it up?
Don't you get your life to make your life to work without that there ever something from the bittere and that you'll die on the puines of your broken dreams with your moud of fail?"
Something in that streting.
And in the short comes to those questions on this is "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called
All of the time.
But I'm also for a lot of other things afraid of things are frightening for which is all of it.
For example, and other environment, and other environment.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time is what that fear is coming from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is afraid to be afraid for work that they are see?
What is so exactly creative processes that we make us to make us to make the effects of the mineshistory, something that is something that happening in other species of work.
Take my father. He was chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was a chemisted to be asked somebody who's working on a little bit of him or not afraid for it.
And so of that "Yohn, how are it with your chemblock?"
No, so it was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair of chemistry engineers have been not crazy the reputation of malcohosts for piece of manically.
You know, they have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers of the other creative people have been pretty instable, the reputation is mental instable.
And if you look at the grimming death the most magnific creative spirit of the 20th century.
And many of them died young, often by their own own stify
And even those who don't even have a suicide place, seem to be under their gave to be under their gave to be able to be including their gave to be suicide to be under their gave to be under their gaine.
In the last interview of his death, Norman Mailer: "My every one of my books is a piece of mind."
And that's pretty much what to say to your life.
But of this kind of spoke of this kind of intention,
We all heard it before, and have heard it before.
The reason is that creativity is that creativity is unlocked with suffering and that a poor eventually inventially inventially included to reduce the way to reflect as an artistic end,
So that's why I want to ask everybody here today to ask anybody here today?
Do you do that OK?
Because I'm going to think about it, I think it's not a very good thought.
I think of the resident.
And also even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century is that this century is so much as well.
We can spore creative spors much better to live in.
I'm sure that it would be for me in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to that dark thought.
In fact, the phase of the phase of my career is now in the front of the phase is in the phase of the phase is in the phase of the phase is now in the phase of the phase is now in which my career on the phase is now
Go too, but I am a little bit of a regard, per year.
I can spend four decade four decade.
Heast probably the way that I'm going to be more more publiceer by the outside of the outside of the work that extraordinary book on that extraordinary book is successful book is that extraordinary book is that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can clap it is probably my biggest success is my biggest success of me.
Jemig, what an idea!
If you think about this is what you're thinking about it for you know in the morning, you know at the drank.
So I don't want to be that.
I love to the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love to me with the work that I love the work that I love love to me with
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I can go to the conclusion that I can just go through write if I can go through a psychological protection in the process.
I have to write a safe distance of creating a safe of distance between myself and my considered very understanding of my future published publications.
I did the last year for ways to do that.
I'm in history, and I have inside of history, and I have found in other civilizations to see or others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to go with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search of my quest has brought me to the old Greeks and Romens.
And I have a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romends and Romomen's time of the old Greeks and Romombs was from himself.
And they believed that creativity is a displayer that was a re, remember, unknown place, to humans and unknown for fage reasonable reasonable reasons.
The Greeks called these Greeks called these crash spirit of creativity "demonit."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that too,
The Romends had a species of the same idea.
In them was a little called creative spirit was a "enjoy."
The funny is that the Romen's not with a genius with a genius to be explained a pient.
In their policy was a kind of magical godleval entitit that was helped in the walls of the poors of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house electrics.
If the artistic was working on the work was assistance.
And he gave it work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance where I talked about earlier -- the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be in his work
The artists was taken by protection to be far as much narcism.
If you were brilliant work and you don't get all honor for it.
Everybody knew that was helping an invisible genius you have helped it.
Don't get your work out, then you know, not just lay to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty independent genius genie.
Long time that has been considered how in the West creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There is a whole new idea: the individual people, the individual human is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the godle-size world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity of creativity of the individuals.
And for the first time in history was about artists said that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not
I have to say that I think I have a big from.
And to one person, one single individual to believe that he or she or she or she is whether she is the essentially of the century mystery, of all of the eternature of everything else and creative -- that's a lot of responsibility for a fragic human psyche.
It's like you to somebody asks the sun in swallows the sun
Egos are actually blown to a giant proportional proportional proportional expectations to prestations for performance to prestations
And I think this pressed the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists
If that is so there, and I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we return back to a parent understanding of relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship and creative mysterio?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years we can rational rational humanism not undone in a 18 minutes,
Probably are in the audience that recently recently have scientific about the idea that elflows on the idea that elfloors with what feetic creatures of the work of artists.
It doesn't seem me that I will get you in that I will get you in there.
And yet me just ask it out.
Why doesn't do it?
Why wouldn't we have that thought don't have to do that thought is?
It just cut as much as much as well-greatment of the total calculated in the total calculity that is decided in the creative process.
Everybody who's trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, all of the attacks here -- you know that the creative process doesn't always rational matter.
And that sometimes it feeling in a paranormal.
I have the great American closer American closer Ruth Stone of the great American dicheating.
And she's thick in the ninet.
She told me her childhood, on the Virginia.
Some times if she was on the field of the work was felt to the work on the country --
It was so so told she was so much as if there was a big wave air
And so that wave over the country,
She felt that the ground, she started to shook her at that point her at that point her at that time, but one thing to have a thing to her life.
She ran home and shed by the poem and she had to do bad as quickly as quickly as possible,
When the poem was that she was gone from her home waves her only chance to write it.
Sometimes she was not quickly enough.
Then they roughness and running it doesn't get the house of it doesn't get the house.
And at the point of this moments the poem by her history -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- in her words -- in a different poem -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in a different poeoevers of
And I also also have a lot of the most beautiful part of the story -- that they have the poem of the story -- that they almost mist.
And then she was in home and paper and paper and paper the paper and paper the poem by her hiches.
Just at that point she had a potleased to get a potled.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she told me them, she was close to the air.
She packed it in his tail, and it back into her body, and it back in her body, while she wrote it.
And in those cases came close to be close to be very close to paper in the paper hundred of paper order.
When I thought I was thought I was -- what accident, so it is that my creative process!
And that's how my creative process! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouthing, who's every day on the same dot on the same time, and swed, sweeping and trans through it, sweeping and trans room.
But even in that daily swood, I had such a experience of a experience.
You will also know it yourself, that feeling that creative ideas in your record, you know, you can identify impossible.
What is that then the source?
How can we use it without we get it without we get it?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it about it.
Tom is actually a big part of his life is a lot of his life was showing the toon-image of the number that is trying to get out of all power is trying to get out of the unconcerative impulsable creative impulsable creative impulsable in him.
And it was Tom a little bit more more restar as a little bit more restar
One day he was in Los Angeles over the fighway, and changed the process of radical.
And as he heard so he heard a fragment,
The decision is to him, like inspiration that does is crowll, cellent.
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to hold it.
But it doesn't go to it.
He had no paper touch, no tape -- no tangic at it.
The well-known exciting against of him: "I read, I got the milk of the galoessentially and then it stays backwards.
I'm not good enough, I can't be too."
He didn't get in panic, but he put that whole mental process and he put that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, don't you can see that I sat up behind the sense of the stuff --
"Do you think I can be able to write a song,
If you really want this song, you have to be able to get later if I have time for you.
You don't know anyone else to anybody else in it.
Ga neighborhoods at Leonard Coh." And from that point the process of lose of the process of very different.
The work itself is the same thing that is the same thing that is the same thing that is such a little bit of the such of the except itself,
But the heavy exciting the creative process in him of the creative process in the way he distinct of genius.
The genius was close to close to the skin and liverse but
And so that there was no reason for the both of it.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and and the ownerable aspect that not completely from Tom themselves.
That story has changed my way of working changed.
I had already profijes of it.
I was in the middle of Exen, Biddle, Beminners.
And at a point moment I degraded in despair.
You know that you want to do work and you don't want to be able to catch a terrible disaster disaster -- the book is eye.
Not just bad bad it, really horrible bad of it.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that are already to be genius and I decided to way.
I walk from my husband, and my fuscrips and founded me to a very empty of the room.
And I said "Look, Look, we know that if this book is not brilliant is not just because it's not just because of my life.
You can see that I have in all of it in what I have in it.
More I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find it better, you have to get your thing to get to your thing to get to your thing
You can you do that? Do you don't do that, you know, you am,
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the noterately are being seen that are just died that is just a different."
Tja--- eventually it comes up here.
Euwest in the North African desert African desert people together to dance in month, to dance in months to dance on sacred music.
Excircle, to the hours, to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, it happened to be something extraordinary happened
One of those dancers then transcendent.
You know whatever I mean, you have ever seen something like this, you ever see something like a performer.
It was like the time stood was stilling and dance the dance of a poor.
He did nothing differently, but now he did anything different.
And suddenly he just a human beings a human being.
In him, under him, under him it.
A godd-up fire.
If something happened that happened to be something like this, Dan people knew what it was began to clap them and in clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historic fact, when the Moren South South South Spanin, they brought this living with it.
The outcome, is the outcome, because of the centuries of the centuries of "Allah." In "Olle, Oh, Allah."
That is that you hear the day still fighting and flaments and flaments,
If an artists in Spain something impossible or magical does, or magically, you know, "Allah, great, okay, felt it, well, well, it's great,
Sepily, disease is a glimpse of God.
And the recipe we need.
Lasty is that the dance of the dance of the dance of the front of the wake of 11 o'clock for 11 hours in the morning.
And now, he is again, it's again, it's against of the angle who never will come to such heights.
Maybe never anybody else to anybody else where.
What does it still have to do with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
And that's really hard to sell a creative spirit for a creative spirit of creative spirit of a creative spirit for a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be so much as it doesn't have to be to.
Imagine that you don't get that the most unusual aspects of your person is from your person from your person is coming out of your person is coming out of your person is coming from your person is coming out of your person is coming from your person are coming from your person are coming.
Imagine that you have given them to be a while, while you can get them to specifying source.
When you are finished somebody else on someone else.
And that's how it considered everything.
I intune inaverage that are thought to be thought of the thought of it.
The last months I've been working on a book that will be short. The book where a lot of time to be across the book where a lot of a lot of time to be reflected to be across to a book for a book to be appropriate to different.
The soluger of that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me go on and go and go and go and I like to go and see the same same one.
Do just do you work.
And if you just do thing you do, whatever it is.
If it you task you to dance you -- thank you for it.
If the godled-lease genius are defined to get in your work at some point of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of "Oly!"
And it doesn't expand dance it it up.
And also "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that I think it's hard.
"Oh, anyway!"Atoo, because we stay human love and property, but it's eventually equality by pluing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen!
You know, I talked about a few of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome and what it can mean and what it can mean, and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually start from a new point of that we were the biology to digitize the biology -- and now we are trying to get from that digital code to a new phase of life.
So we have always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think about a lot of biologists have tried to understand in different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different level of biologists have tried to understand in different level of biologists have tried to understand in a different levels.
We tried different approached approach, it back to the minimum components.
We're almost 20 years of digitize the digitize of digitize
And when we have sequenced the human genome. And then went from the analoge world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask life: can we regenerate new life to create new life, or can we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome.
And we tried to look at if we can get to a nice smaller.
We can go in the hundred of hundred of the 500 or something, which are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relative to the metabolo.
And this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch, it's very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell of the genes that would be able to switch as we can bring a living cell of the genes we can switch,
And we decided that the only route that the only route was to synthesize this chromosome. And so we could make the components to make the components to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions, "Can we started a chromosome, "Can himself synthis?"
Stag the chemistry to make these very big molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, a chromosome, "rais?
A chromosome of the way, is just a little bit of the chemical chemical include material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of life is accelerating is accelerating on exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic code of slowly, but is applied for
And our last point it would take a moment in this moment on a moment in an exponential curve.
We're talking about 15 years ago.
There were some stages for for invited to start with a bio-ethical ethical across the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult.
There are tiends of thousands of machines in the world that make little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you have a lot more mistakes are in the world that makes it pieces of it.
So we had to make a new method for connecting these little pieces and correct the little pieces of all errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of these little pieces of tune --
And this was our first attempt, to start the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria little virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, we did the pieces of the bunch
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we put a piece of chemical chemical style in the bacteria and the bacteria the genetic code and viral particles and making the genetic code, and making the genetions and making the genetic code in the bacteria
The viral particles were taken from cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and killing the E.
I was disconnected with the oil industry, and I said they were model and I said they cut too fast;
They laugh more than you.
So we think this is a situation where the software is built its own hardware is building in a biological system.
But we wanted something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes, so we could actually build the cassettes that we could various the cassettes --
to understand what the intention of the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start starting with digital information in the computer than must be very accurae.
And when we first assumed this genome in 1995, the default was the dead-one false papers.
And eventually we found after resequencing. If we had the original sequence than it was used it in the original sequence than it was not able to start on the way.
And the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that are 50 letters to have a long time that are such on all other pieces of 50 letters to build so that we have to design so that we have to design so that they can design together.
We design unique parts in the fact of that we are designing in the unique parts.
Maybe you have read that we put out in the watermarks.
Do you think we have a four-letter-genetic code: A, C, Go and T.
Trios of those letters cos for ruwy's 20 aminosh -- that there's a little bit of a single diverse for every aminoxximacygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sing words, seeing the genetic code to be able to use the genetic code to write the genetic code to write words,
And we just understand more signs we just get to me.
Some of them were founded that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzymes.
There are enzymes that they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of pieces that were five to 7,000 letters of a long time, they were five to 7,000 letters long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, take it to 72,000.
In every single dium, we have a consider of these pieces so we could sequences them because we want to create a process that is very robusted -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust --
We try to achieve the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbalfinal finale.
Once we get to the real big pieces -- over 100,000 basepares, they don't grow so easy more in E.
That does explain the most of all modern tools of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to get to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolotic recombination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair of a member.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million radiodurans that three million radiation.
And that you see in the top panel, set up the top of the ground, just sopm from one another.
12 ot 24 hours later he put it again the other one, and exactly like it was first of all.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drought up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space, that can be moving in space, that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has show that there's a lot of the way, there is a lot of the outside.
Here's a declass that we have made of the molecule that we have made with these processes -- actually just yeahisms -- actually only yeastern mechanisms with the right design.
And it is that they add automatically feet.
This is not an electron-microscope photo; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken about a six seconds
This is the publication that we spent recently.
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by humans, with a dished structure.
The molecule is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages to the genetic code the genetic code of genetic code
Now, how do we start, how do we start a chromosom? How do we activate it?
And it's obvirus it's obviously.
And I think it's a much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you the eukaryots, like us, you just wheels -- you just know the cell and does another in the cell.
In the bacteria species of the chromosome, it's chromosome, but we have recently, we have to have a full transplantation of a chromosome.
We have a chromosome of a micro-and-a-foot memorial species.
These are about as far from each other.
We add some extra genes so that we could take this chromosome.
We have been touched with enzymes to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graph graph graph -- the new chromosome.
We even thought he would come to come to soil but we tried to develop the process of what to do.
This is an essential evolutionary mechanism.
We found out all kinds of sorts of kinds of chromosome, or a third chromosome, or a third of thousands of properties in one times in one times.
People that are proposing evolution as if there are one changes of the same way that we have been able to do it.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes that are actually called DNA to response.
The chromosome was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome, we put in it -- we put in it.
It was expressed, and it recognized the other chromosome, as strange as strange of material, and so we eventually had the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue because he was the genes that we had put in it.
And in very short time disappeared all the characteristics of one species of the new species of shaped in the new software that we put in the new software that we put in the cell.
All of the proteins, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code -- it was the exactly where it was changed.
This is a major of sounds like genomic-alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamental power.
Now, I've been paid earlier that this is not a creation of a creation -- this is a 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid an new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of new species of scale design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty clearly as you look at what it is.
We're going to go into the corport of six-and-half billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in my context in 1946.
There are now three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 460s.
We have encourage with food, with the heavy water, drugs, fuel for the six-and-a-half billion.
And that's hard to do that for net.
We use five billion tons of collapsed over 30 billion vessels
That's 100 miloons of lions per day.
When we take biological processes in the ogency of biological process than also to replace that is going to be a huge challenge; then it goes to be a huge challenges.
Then of course, there's all these carbon dioxide of the following that is in the atmosphere really come.
And in fact, we have our global discoveries we now have a database with about 20 million genes, and that I'd like to see as the designer for the future.
The electronics industry had only a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is front of the electronics had come from the electronics had only come to the diversity that has come from the electronics had only come from the electronica-industry had a dozen different components, and then the electronica-a-industry of componenses.
We are precisely conststant by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques now, thank synthesesemethods to do so-called combination genomics.
We now have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day of chromosomes.
If you think about the process, you know, is to optimes, or is trying to optimate processes to make octan, or produce octan, or new vaccines, we can change with a little team -- we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard of selection.
We can select for life-fashion of life, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design, which is a real design, so you can actually go to the causes and a new kind of on the computer and a new kind of computer to design and a new kind of computer
We don't know person how it will look like it.
We know how their genetic code their genetic code from the genetic code
We now fourth of now fourth generation fuels.
Recethanol to ethanol to ethanol experiment.
We have second generation fuel of fuel of generation that will come out of sugar, to more high-grabs like sugar, to more fuel of different species like octanol.
But the only way we think we can think that biology can have big influence without the food prices and available to reduce the only way we start with CO2 as his food, and so we are going to be able to design and we are doing to design that we are the first fourth generation of that way, and we think we do the first fourth generation of fuels in about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- -- but by our world -- -- but by our world discoveries are all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles depth of a half miles depth of cooking heavil.
It makes methane of CO2 with ce-molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 -- which is easily through pipipes that are easily through riefs, where that is is form to send this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are capable of thinking that we are able to break out of the basal question: What is life?"
We actually have real, you know -- the regions of targets of the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED where?
A major energy source of energy source.
But we also work now now now on these tools to think about quickly servaccines of vaccines of vaccines to think about it.
This year there was the flu, we always walk in the fluence of the facts as it comes on the right vaccine.
I think that can change change from textile of teforming vaccines.
And here is how the future can see what the future, is going to change the evolution tree is going to change with synthetic bacteria, archeukaryota.
We are still avoid away from the improving people.
Our goal is to ask that we make a chance to survive for a long enough to survive that probably you can do that maybe do that.
What I want to show you you as quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we were in a new technology that we were in a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment where you can locally or on the distance with immense amounts of visual data.
We look at a lot of gigabytes of digital images and can stay on the way in the case and except the sorts of our lives.
And it doesn't matter how much information we have to look at how big these collections are or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan from the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel and is in the 300 megapixely.
It all doesn't matter because it is the only thing that would affect the only thing that would influence on a global system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a completely book, an example of data.
This is a graue house by Dickens. Each coluccer is a headquare.
And to prove that it's really textest that is really textest and not imagination, we can do something like this, to show that this really isn't a picture.
Maybe this is a strange of a strange way to read a strange of read a honor book
I wouldn't be addition to it.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Each big picture is the beginning of a subject of a submitted of a big.
This is really the job and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have done something that we did something with the corner of this excellent of The Guardian
We made a crap advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extracted information --
If you see the possibilities of this car is you see it.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limit of hands of hands through the screen through the screen through the screen through the screen
We hope that this is not a pop-ups and other such flaul -- not needed to be more than it will be able to be more than it will be able to be more flaul -- not needed to be more flaul -- not needed to be flaul in the flaul --
Of course are landmaps a candle for the hand, is applicating for a technology like these, I'm going to spending on here to this field, except that we can contribute to this fields of a lot of the considering of this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now a live on the Web; you can see it on the Webb,
This project called Photosynth, which is connected with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other thing is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, provening the University of Washington,
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's front possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this one, you know, we have diving the pictures and the multi-resolution resolution --
The root of the pictures of the pictures is the pictures of the pictures is the images of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the images is the images of the pictures of the images of the pictures of the images of the images of the pictures of the images of the images of the images of the images of the pictures of the images of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the picture
The computer vision of the computer vision of these pictures so that they require with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genome. And so you can see elements of stabilized stabilized diassident of these things are space.
I'm not sure or there is another time, other environments.
There are a lot of space.
I want to like one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynthic we worked prototypical of this summer -- to the communicate is the real, which I have in my head, the realization of our website.
We had to have a calculation with the lawyers and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with pictures from Flickr. You just search a pictures in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the
And each of these orange chases gives a picture that was a picture that was part of this model turns out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this orange that was part of this orange that was part of this orange that was part of this orange that was part of this orange ches that was part of this orange that was part of this orange that was part of this orange that was a picture that turning from these orange of model that was part of this
And so these are all Flickr pictures, which are in this way of copied copied in this way of copied --
And we can do a simple way we can do it.
You know, I never thought that I would have never worked at Microsoft
It's overwhelming here is so untouched to be so under here.
I believe you can see that this is a lot of cameras is that all of the gsm to mirror reflexcameras, a lot of them together, a big number of it,
And I'm going to try to find some strange images.
There are so much covered by facing faces and so on.
And somewhere between the other is even a series of pictures -- here are all of the time.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also chose by the program.
If we did, you know, we dive the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data of everyone -- from the whole collective memory of the entire collective memory, the Earth -- and the Earth -- and the Earth.
All these photos are connecting with each other, and form together is a very little bigger than the sum of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth is state.
So this is a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Add:
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use, and the previous of which is growing for the people who use it.
Their own photographs of metap-data that somebody else invotes in the way of the metap-
If somebody would want to clip all of these heads and their names and their names is going to be agreement with all of that data, and I can use as a access to the space, which I can use as a access to the space, which is used from every photographs, and created with this kind of cross-modulthal, and created with this kind of cross-falthough social experience.
And of course, it's the by-product of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place, on Earth, who just not only photographs, satellits, and other applies; it's defined from the collective images.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that makes you have software possible on a day, in the next years, in the next years, all images that can cope in the next years, all of the images that can copy?
BA: Yeah. What this really does does do is discovering.
It creates, to your wish and hyperlinks between pictures.
And it does that based on the basis of the data in the pictures.
And that is emeraccess when you think about the richchales of semantic information that are accessing far of these pictures are accessive that are accessive of the images.
When you look at the web page for images, you feel a search and the text on the webheat the webpage of information on what the pictures on what the pictures on what the pictures on what the pictures on the web,
What if now is that picture that picture is to all your images?
Then are the number semantic connections and the amount richchness that comes from that is a classic networks effect. It's a classic networks effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense places of traveling and of eating evil, the opportunity to live between those who are not forget to live in the old liumed of the ancient who feel in the wind, which is in the wind, the point in the wind, profits, the proficless.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still are traveling the Milky Way, or that the myths of Inchoring the myths of the Himalaya boodhist still and in the Himalament still mama, remember that in the breath of Dhars you remember really depended in the world in which we livests life: the world in which we lives in an absolutely but is not just one model of the reality,
the consequence of a accidentally, apply choices that made our ancestors of generations.
Of course, we all share the same advancis: Words born. Brendered children in the world. Brendered children in the world.
We all make invention inrites that are all inventions.
And then go with the intancy divergency die.
So it can be surprise that we all of all singing, and dance
But interesting is the unique cadans of the song, and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the Voodoo-acolites in Haiti, or the Caisute in North Kaisut in North Kaisutter-Kenya, the Curn Curtures in the Sahara. This is the Caravanai of Sahara. This is the desert of the Sahara. This is the death,
Everest, the god-ddle-dder of the world.
They're all learning us that we can think different, we can think different, different, our other oriens.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of it.
Samming cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that is emerging the planet and to her as the planet and for her just as important as the biological lifes: the biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine as you can imagine as a eat.
The evil feet you can define if the total of all the thought of all the thought of all thoughts, myths, and myths, ideas, inspirities that are previous and intuitions that are conscioutics that are consciousness.
The etnosed is the big nalature of humanity.
And she's symbol of all we are and all of that we can be and all of that we can be as amazing curiosity of animals.
And not like the biosphere is aware is the eattest is that too, and even in much larger mate.
No biologist would be not consider that would be at least half of all the species on the point of extinction is not true true true that is simply not true.
And the most optimistic scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhoot of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is losing is the loss.
And when everybody born here was born there were six-thousand languages on Earth are spoken on Earth are spoking.
A language is more than her word her or her grammmatic rules.
A language is a dishes of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that is the soul of every unique culture the material world is reaching the material world that is reachied.
Each language is a century ancient old and a disease of an ecosystem -- a separtment of spiritual opportunities.
From that six-thousand of languages today.
They're not longer took babies longer to be babies longer
Effective means that unless a change change, that they are already dead.
Is there something like this, then to be affected by the state of your entire totally are your language, no chance to have no chance to give the wisdom of the ancestation of the kids?
And reciipe that tergenous is somewhere on the Earth state every two weeks somewhere on Earth, because every two weeks and dies it dies a older and dies done the last letter of an old language.
Some of you say, "Super, the world don't have better place, if we all all the world are we all all the same language. I say, "Super, llet me take Yoruba take Or Kantone: Or Kantone: Or Kantone: "Super, let's take it all the time.
Or Kogi.' You will realize you realize how it would be not talking to talk about your own language.
So what I want to do today is to take you on a short journey by the eval nosphenomenon of what is actually lost a picture of what is actually lost a picture of what is actually lost a little bit of a shoot of what I want to be lost to be lost of what I want to do today.
And many of us forgotten that when I talk about "another way of being in a different way of the other way's goal.
Take this Barasana-child in the North West Amazone, the anaconda, which believes that believes that believes that believes that believes that believes that believes that is in the buI took in the buI was in the buI was in the buI ttunes.

They have a regular language and marriage, which is called linguistic exogamy exogam: you have to married somebody else that speaks a different language.
This is roots in the mythological past, but it extraordinary enough in their homes, where six or seven languages where six or seven language, but you never hear of these crossing marriage, but you never hear practices.
They are simply listening and then speak.
One of the fascinating tribes that I have lived with which I lived in Norani in Norani in Norani in Norani in North Ecuador, a bluffect in 1958 ves;
In 1957 tried to be able to contact five missionaries, but they made a critical error,

They got the photographs on and tried to find the face.
When they found nothing they found that the double they conclude them with this pivel rying, the missionaries are spearth with spear.
But the Waorani continues to not only outside of the Waorance, but also each other.
Fifth of their deaths came out of the deaths of breaking out of the board of breaking
We could enjoy genealogies to eight generations back and eight generations, where we found two cases of a natural death.

If you start to create the idea that these cultures can create different reality of these cultures can be understanding for some of their extraordinary discovery. Take this plant.
It's a picture that I april in the North West Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive will, from the repertoire of the shaman.
What makes ayhouse is so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potentially to it, but how it is built it is built from two sources.
And so, there's a wooden that are contained carbon and heart and harmaliny and harmaline wears and light hallucinating light hallucinating light and hallucinating light and heart hallucinating and heart point and heart hallucine,
If you take the plant folor it looks like a blue of blue is floating your consciousness.
The plant is malong with leaves of a coffee of a coffee of a viridis.
The plant is powerful tryptamines, nauthor references in the brain serotonine, dimethoxia ptamine, 5-methoxyltry-ptamine,
Do you ever see the Yanomami if they put that snuion, which is substance of different species that too, who has methoxyltryptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ltrydimethoxed the Yanomami ltrydimethoxi,
That powder your nose in the box, is as from a memorize as a memorize of the barock pictures to a sea of electricity. This is not a distortion of realit; it creates of realit; it creates of reality -- it creates of reality
I tried to try to convince my professor, Richard Evan -- a man who did -- a man who did the psychedelian agent of psychedelic avers in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was paying that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when it involves involved in the effect is to experience the home. Tryptamines are not to take the hallucination because they are unoral, because they are of their effect in the human darm-chance in the human darm-channe: monoxia -- monoxia: monoxiday.
They can only be oral oral with something that the monoamine of soamine is impurpose.
The fascinating is that the paper carbon in the lide of the gaps in the gaps are to activate the gaps to activate the tryptamine. Imal yourself the question: How can this in a flora of 80,000 plants of two morological untological untangible species that are combined species that are shapitchemical various species that is of the partomin's shape of the partnerships that is in the shape of the shape that is of the shape of the shake of the shake of the shake of the shape of the shape of the parine of the partamineu
We say eufemistic "trial and -- that is being determine as meaningless.
The Indians say, "The plants talk, "The plants talked to us to the Cofan, the Cofan, knows 17 variants of ayahhome who can identify all on big distance that they can identify as one species of the eyes like one of the state as one species would have to be a kind of such as one species of the Indians like one of the face of axy, which can identify all of the Indians like one of the Indians who can identified from all the big ches that they are of the planet that they talks.
If you ask their taxonomy in map of map in the task of plants.

Now, the problem is that even those of us that even those of us who are sympathic incorport insimated them as a curious and coloring colorful and colorful to a footnature in history, and the real world, meaning our world, is continued to the world --
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember of the 20th century to be remember of technological innovations, but earlier as the era in which we were in it, and active participatary, or profoundations or passive destruction to the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity.
All cultures are always determine to a dance with new life possibilities.
And technology is not the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians don't stop Sioux, when they push their pipile, as they put their pile, as well, as much as they have to be able to be in Americans when they way.

And eventually it comes up to a choice.
Can we live in a gray world of events or can we live a colorful world of diversity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she feet, that we are accessing a generals, amorf world pictured image --
We wouldn't only see we see the human imagination of human imagination to a small model, but also we would have have been going to be able to see that there are other operations.
We can feel us in the idea that our species is about about the idea that our species about 150,000-year-old one.
The Neolitical Revolution, which is our agriculture where we gave across the cult of the seed when the shaman was replaced by proshaman by proshaman by proshaman by proshaman and we found a decade by specialization and we had a defense 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
This surface history that we have to give me the idea that we have all the answers to all the answers that will come to our path.
If the intelligic cultures of the world to be asked the meaning of humans are asked to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we are going to discover the opportunity to be able to discover all of the people, which is a full species of the work and make all the garden to be able to flower. There are great. There are large-moments of optimism.
This picture picture I have taken on the North point of Baffin Island then I went to Inextently narwal
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inexist. In the 1950s, to focus on the end, to save our sovernments.
The opa of Olayuk re.

He unfelt the dog and improvised a harnames
And the ribbbitched a bad thing.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood, and he was going to get over the ice foot of the ice foot poods.
Over with nothing to speak around the world. And this is symbol for the resisted of the Inin and all the influences of the Inin and all the inhead,
In april 19999 gave the Canadian government back from a piece of country bigger than California and Texas California and Texas we have new home.
It's independent. They are independent. They are all the ground.
It's a amazing example of how a nation enough, to her people can block to her people.
And finally, I think it's clearly in the world is clear, at least for who is require to those highlight of the world is really, that they actually don't get away.
They're somebody's home country.
They are going to be at the beginning of human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all of these kids, are going to be the dreams of these kids, are being part of a indeed, part of a bunch of hope.
What we finally do at the National Geographic, is extremely from the idea that politicians never reached anything else.
We think that is polemic -- we think that a polemic, but we believe that storytells the world can change the world that can change the world, that we probably the best storytells are in the world is 35 million times a month, we are in 156 million countries in 156 countries on TV and our magazines a millions of public dizzze.
We make a felt to travel to the eator to the eat, with our public, to such a particular cultural places, where the totally getting so identifying as identify that he sees, so hopefully affect to live in the anthropology will be able to live in a variety of the diversity that we can find a way to live in a multicular and pluralistic world
where all the way of the people, can contribute to our minds.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you with you a single questions, which I have a book for which I have a book for recently.
Maybe you see paralls that you can see paralls from other sources.
I am also trying to explain some sense of what I think you might have been meant to you may have me."
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all Western industrialized society.
And that official dogma is lucky as a follow-to-of-foot spors on the highest level of our citizens, we have to give them as much individual free of them as much as possible to give them as much individual free of our citizens.
Freedom is a big good good at is an essential part of the human being.
And the things that are details us to do to treat our own insult to reach a higher more prosperitors.
The ultimate freedom we find in choicicality.
More choices is that people have more free free with more free choices
And more free means automatically means more well.
This is so deep so deep in our society that nobody would take to it.
And in our lives is this dogma urban excise of the chaker.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choicy freedom.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about threats.
And in the super-and-classions of threats are threats of these are different mists of cut brand-vigin oil and twalong tigh.
And you can make it of tune in the end, for the case between 175 species for you, in the front of you don't have anything to it.
So that's the attacked of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can put your stereoset -- loud of it, casion, radio, cass -- cassetttesple --
In that one electronicastore.
You can put together six-and-half million different systems, with parts of parts of those stores.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young ago you could have all sorts of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You have the access of it. You bought it.
That was the way that the advantage that the progress.
That time is forward.
Today there are a lot of different device of different actions.
And in the mobile phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- which was the middle -- which was nose and crishing cry-break brought to be able to get rid of the fun break of it.
The other thing that you don't see this model in the store of the store of his store, but you can be sure that that's happening.
The consequence: people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question is that question
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile of that doesn't do too much do it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the attackle of stuff, this explosive explosive of choices is a fact of choices a fact.
And it's not the U.S. it's in the U.S. include is not that you go to the doctors that you have to doctor, and that you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A or we can do B --
A front of these and nadistributttters.
B has this front and down. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dctor, what do you find in the way of think?"
And the doctor says, "A considering these and navel distributttter, and B display it.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do cooper, if you was doing?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own inbrings of the patients."
That sounds very positive, but in fact, in fact, that the heavy of decision, the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor -- to a life's sure and not the best condition to a seem, somebody who is free and not the best condition to take decision, and the patient is getting a lot of recipe of recipe -- the patible metabune.
Good up to the nerature that ners, because the purpose, you and I can, you and I can, you can't buy it.
Why do do do do if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we think we are going to be able to ask our doctors to ask that other maybe really,
Our identity, yet a price, equipment of us are now overbull, as you can see on this slide on this slide.
Our identity's deground.
We find ourselves -- we just want to be -- so often we want.
Every single morning to be considering what you have to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There has been a time that freezing everybody else out of the car that you could have so fast as quickly as possible, and then as fast as possible to kids.
The only choice was with whom was not when and what you do is not when and what you do is what you do is what you do is what you do is what you do is what you do is what you do is what you did.
Now is free everything for the up.
I teach eventually intelligent students, which I have eventually event less househigh-homework than ear.
They are not dommer or than in the early time.
No, they have it pressure.
"Well I married, well, or not?
Or I'll wait? Do I wait? I first want to wait?
These are all the way of ask questions.
They are going to have a answer to them as it means that they don't get all their homework and not cut their homework and not cut up with a good number.
And they have right. They're important living questions.
And then we come to work with work and Carl just already all of that technology is allowing every minute of every day -- except in the world that -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place, which I love secret that I love it, where WiFi does it does.
I don't think because I want to keep that because I want to keep that for myself.
But anyway, that huge choicy choices of work in that we are incredibly asked for them, or we go to work or not.
We can look at a football we'll see our son, with our son, with our son, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and our laptop here.
And even if they all get out of it, are we all of every minute of that compete with all sorts of questions, "Am I response this phone call?
Can I write this ise emailing tar? Is I write this letter?"
And even if the answer is "Nee," we experience the football of our son in a very different way.
And what we also look at the big, the big, materialistic things, life: life style: life is a question of choos: life is a question of choos;
And so that the world used to be saw the world to it.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about what is good about what is bad to talk about it.
That huge choicy choicy choices two effects, two negative effects, two negative effects, two effects,
A very contrast, it's a very considered effect is that the earlier than conventions.
And so much choices people find the hard to make a choice.
I'm going to give you a whole dramatic example of that, a research to invest investigate pensioent.
A colleague of me got access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a big policy-foot society with one million employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 reflections of founds.
And they found that for every decade for every decades that the worked on the worked far two percent degrade --
In five of five founds, 10 percent employees than five than five than five than five throm?
Because it is so hard to choices so hard to chose that people just exactly the choices that people just choice, and that on it, and that on it, and so on.
And from the equally comes out.
That means not just that people after their depensionation don't have a dried bread because they don't have enough money because they have put enough, but also that the choice known that the choice known that they have a determine of them are so hard to make answer.
They had them to go to 5,000 dollars a year on their nose nose for 5,000 dollars a year to their nose.
The worked was far to double to double their own contribute their own contribute to double.
So for a lot of choicity can be lost paralyzing.
And I think the world is looks like that.
If it goes to the century to you very like to do you really want to be very like to do the right choice, right?
You don't want to be employed with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
And that's the first effect. The second thing is that we have to be aware of the dismiss of our disals, eventually less tepearing with the result of the result of the result than the case, if we had less options have had less options.
There are multiple reasons for about it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tallow to appear that the choice, it doesn't look that the choice.
You put you in a case for that a different choice would have been better.
This dream of alternative is that you speak of you get spired of your choice.
And then you spend on the front of the choice that you have made it in the choice you have made even like a good choice.
The more options, the more option, it's too easier to have more spired of uncompared to have more reported option.
Second is a second reason has to be substitutional cost
Dan Gilbert gave already of how often we depend the value of things that we depend the value of things that we are comparing.
If you can include your many alternatives you all see the attractive to the attract of all alternatives that you define that you did.
That makes you fewer at less of the alternative that you chose are chosen
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stressing of this example.
This is a couple is in the Hamptons.
They have a third wound.
They are on a wonderful brand. Straling weather. It's not human in vision.
Don't do not it? "Don't be able to think, "Well, it's audomin."
Everybody in my neighborhood, Manhattan is the city.
I could get my car for the door, for the door."
And he is two weeks, with the idea that he misline that he misline every day again,
And substitutional cost of the entire that we have, even if we have a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are there to be the more attractivities are more attrack.
And those are presenting us as substitutional cost
Another example.
This picture is what happened is to a number of points.
Life in the here, and now for example, and you don't have to get things to get away to get away to get away to get away to get away to it.
Another point is that you can get with every other choices of choices
And all that other has so his attractive to be bad as the chose of options, which is being bought less attractive to be able to be adapully.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse
I almost always speak almost always greenhouse
But, there was only one kind of a kind of spirit bought you couldn't be the past, the past, it doesn't cate, but if you the breet, but if you the greenhouse and often enough and often enough and often enough and often enough and often enough it up.
And after years I went to the store for a news.
I said, "Then I want to get a spirit -- this is my me."
And the store said, "Do you get fit, easy or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you want to butttons or a rhys? Whilt or an acid-washed?
Do you want to get a bree-effect?
Do you want to take something expanding or whether or flink out, and so he went through it.
I was there for a little bit of it. And after a while, I want to say, "I want to get the only one."
He had no idea what he had no idea that was and so I have an hour for a hour long hours of all the possible greenhouse to go on and adapty.
And it was quite honest, I left the store of the store of the store of the bottom,
I could have done it better. And I could do it anything that could do I do better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To this to myself out of this on myself, I wrote a book of a book of a book
The reason I don't feel better, with all that choice, was that I started expecting to expect more to expect the strength of a good speak of a good track.
I started without any any of any expectances one kind of spirit of a spirit of spalong of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit
And then it turns out there were different and one of them would be fast perfect.
What I was bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I compared to my greenhouse with my expectations, and that asked me to be countered with my expectanced --
The more possibilities people have to be expectations they have to cattacks about the deservices of those possibilities.
And that means people are less testing with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Markeing people don't know this.
because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
And in the real thing is going to be about it.
Everything was bad when everything was bad when everything was bad at the time.
because when everything was bad there was bad to surprising experiencing experiences.
In our modern society we can we as as well as a well as a profounds, but the best thing we can ever achieve is something that we can ever achieved, is something so good as we expect.
Never we get touched up, because our expectations, my expectations, are tower, and high.
The secret of happiness -- this is not to be a lot of happiness, the secret of happiness.
I want to be here -- a little bit of a car biographically elementally -- that I'm reliefly with a woman is really fantastic.
I have asked her to her less tepear with less tepeared at less tepeared
But less enough takes are good canns.
And finally, when you have a bad bad on the bad is bad like one of these are only one kind of predicting, you can ask why you are intouch of why you are intouches of why you are intap.
The answer is that case in that case.
The world is responsible. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different greenhouse and you buy it turns out to fill it out to the point that is responsibilit?
The answer thing that is just as simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different greenhouse to false.
So if people decided to make people decisions of those decisions are good decide of those decisions of their choice.
And they take it to take itself.
In the Western society clinic depression under the younger generations of younger generations of at the younger generations of
A factor -- not the engineering factor, but a significant factor in this explosive explosive and suicide suicide of depression and suician experience of their high expectations.
And if they try to explain that teleurion, they are trying to explain themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettoresulat is that we spoken on it, but our behaviors on it.
Another a summarged as a consider.
This is the official dogma, which is that by everybody is going to be reflecting for where everybody is being being there.
But that's not.
It doesn't suffers that can choose better than not can choose better, but it doesn't have a lot of car is not casting automatically that choice is even better.
There is a magical ground-sea possibilities. Well that don't know.
But I know that we are all free for a long time of the point that choicy of us well-being.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best one.
The choices of industrialized countries is prevent of material considered countries from material considered countries
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about what the problem is not so much more choice, but it's too much choice, but it's a lot of choice.
