Last year, I showed these two sdia's to show that the Poile of the pool, who had about the last three million years of the vast three million years of the United States with 40 percent of the United States with 40 percent of the United States with 40 percent of the United States with 40 percent of the United States with 40 million years of the day's shaping the pider
But this is actually the nst of this particular problem because it doesn't show the dished of the ice of ice to show the ice.
The polar set on the North Pool is in a shape heart of our global climate system.
It set out in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide that I shows is a accell version of what the last 25 years.
And the permanent ice is done in the preventing.
As you see, it comes out to dark blue.
That's the year, the year, in the winter.
And the crimpt in summer.
The so-called permanent, five years or older, five years or almost like flower, which is almost like floor.
In 25 years is the way this is to this to this is to this in 25 years.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icell and flowing up there is a very big amount of woman, and they have a very big amount of carbon the death, when the death, when the death,
And I think of total amount of diverse in the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, that could be able to divide the amount of the engage point of the atmosphere.
In some undies in a few undeep in Alaska board, in the water.
And the last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alasa different team to another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different undeep more.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question is to be right.
A reason for that, this huge is that this huge of heat bron" Greenland from the north of warming from the north of warms.
This is a melt aterriver two.
The water-volume is the water-catch volume
This is the Kangerlussuain South river in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea single of the sea because the landif, is the place where it comes into the sea place where it comes in the sea of sea
These stroming are taking floor.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice ice mass on Earth.
And the last month, of course scientists that the whole continent now, is negative ice balance --
More specific is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly, very quickly, very quickly, so,
The whole continent to six feet of seespear, just like Greenland.
In Himalaya, the two after largest ice ice ice ice ice ice -- are new notice that a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets the help of his drinwater of that melties.
In the Anths, this glestyer the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more stroms.
But when they disappearing and disappears drink water.
In California was a four four, of 40 percent in the snow,
It comes to the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dreaming square has ago, to a dramatical styer of food.
And the number of course all over the world is spent with an unbelievable and never seen a faster and never seen a faster and never seen a faster and never seen a unbelievity.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely unkeep unkeeping in the pattern is completely unket.
If you look at the way from a historic context of a historic context of what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 across CO2 four hour.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, and look at the eye of the eye of the Stille of the Stille of America, and in the way from America, and at every single south of India's subcontinent, there is a drastic daling of the oceans.
The only big cause of the earth, the earth, the next to deforest in the earth, which is the source of fossil fuels of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and steal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding in China.
And there was a lot more support carbon centrales in the centrales.
But we see a commemes of a cra.
These are the coal-carbon centrales where the bombat, in the last years, and where green alternatives were proposed to forget forget forget forget forget forward to the coalternatives forward in the last years,
There's a political stater a political state,
The urban carbon and oil industry gave 250 million dollars to promote "shone" and sone" and promots, which is a contradiction,
And that image did something to be thinking about something to me think.
And I was the guy was at home in Tennessee, about four billion literers, about four billion literally belied.
You probably seen it in the news of news.
This is the one after largest dish in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the support set of the Kerst was the Kerster was doing it.
Video: ""Frosty the voice, is a stay of the coal guy is a stay guy of cool.
He's fquick on this in America, and he care in America, and he care growing our economy.
Frosty the coal carbon man is scree with the day of the day
He's paid and deployees and employees and employees their job."
Here is a big part of the voice coal in West Virginia chose of Virginia fied from from the cool of the coal coal in West Virginia.
The largest minerrors of the country is the big bad of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship ship -- "Let me be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know where they haven't worry about it,
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimating protection of Klimating protect on the bottom.
This is a little bit of a little bit of it.
And Video "Big COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why the reason why it's why the most important is to give us a giant to give a giant to the light and the light to the light and the light of truth of the truth of stead,

So, you don't make worry about climate change change
Let me go to our following us of it.
Video: Acteur: Schone stead, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern cross city centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are making a little bit of lawys.
But that's the sound of shone carbon technology.
In dancing the fact that the fact that the branches of the most important causes of the Earth is changes the remarkable of the Earth is shaping cools that you see here.
Look at the shape carbon technology of cools today is the shape.

The red wire in all these things, our dependence of fossil fuels, and initted in collipipe,
But now there's a killed new solution to get out of this.
And of America 100 percent shack of shaping electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to work to work on the work of work, a plan that safer and the healing of the Earth and the Earth is the Earth is a furniture of the Earth
And in fact, a solution that reflect is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. On the set of the shape.

We have to go far far far far far far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave a introduction on the LHC at TED.
And I promised back to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am here -- and the ones who haven't ware, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever underneath in the entertainment of the entertained in the engineer.
It has to be the circumstances that were attacked at less than a billion, less than a billion,
Enorm ambitius, so, so!
This is the machine of Generies.
We took these mini-Big Bangs in the detectors in detectors and and this is the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters -- 44 meters breed, 22 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in attacular so that you can see the scale.
And at 10 september set of the first time we first put the machine for the first time,
This picture was taken by AS.
That causes a party in the control cam.
It's a picture of the first particle the first particle that all around the way from the LHC and set with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is the detector in the detector of the detector flowing a photograph of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine working that the machine is a huge consider.
I don't know if this is the biggest act, or this thing, or this, when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page of the Internet page of business as the Internet page of it.
That means we made a very cultural as a scientific impact of the scientific impact of the science of impact as a scientific impact of the cultural as a scientific impact of the cultural as a scientific cultural as a scientific impact that we have a cultural as a scientific cultural as a cultu
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to make with these golden behavior.
These draming behaviors of a thousand of amper cooperation works.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's true. It's true.
They can do that because they can do superago, in all the lower temperaturies.
So on min 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can be radied by the side.
In one of the connective between the nine of the nets of the LHC, was a constructive constructive a constructive of the nets of the neine of the neine of the nets of the nets of the nets of the constructive of the nets of the nets of the connective.
and it was wire a wire of the wire was including electric resistance against that 13 thousand of ampeers.
This was the result.
This is still impressive if you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons of weather than 20 tons -- and they were going to be moving about 30 centimeters.
We had to do about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We all repared them when they all repartnerships.
Now they are back on the way.
Eind map the LHC will be intouch again.
We will go back and put it back and we expect measures in June or right so we can go and go out and look for the universe of the universe of the universe are building the universe are building the universe are building the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, those are incidents the debate again, the value of the value of scientific research. It's easy to contract
I think it's a very hard to be so difficult that we go further than the value of things like the LHC.
I show the last words to the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to defined the disappears of his teachers of his teachers, his teachers of his teacher-said, "Nsomething that was so dangerous Faraite, "Nothing is a dangerous for the human mind to take the human mind that we have not been able to take the images of science that there are not a new world's inside of the world of the world of the winner's scientist and that are not have a new world."
Thank you.
I would want to start with you to ask you go back to your children at your children time, when you play with blocks.
And then you discovered how to gray it, and they were conscious and conscious, and you actually solve the teaching and hands from space relationship and hands from space relations.
Rumtelevisial is destrong to understand the world to understand of the world to us.
If an information of information, inspired by the nut of the interact of physical interaction with objects -- and with my adviser Pattion and my fashion Kalanii -- what I started to ask me -- what we would use a computer to ask a computer to ask a computer to the other digital vinger to a case that moves on a plate of individuate fe to a case of individual charge with information of information and information with the neighborh.
and ordering orders, as we want to do it?
These question of us so contained us so that we decided to seek a single answer by building Sifttables.
Siftton is a Sifttable to interactive computer of a cow-size.
They can be moving with the hand they can feel each other, their movement and they can detect a shape and wireless and wireless contact and wireless contact with the hollow-shape and wireless to the hand wireless to the hand wireless their movement and they can be contain the hundred of the hand they felt a screen and they can be invent each other.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handleblock, just like blocks can they be moved by gray to gray it.
And the top of the top of the Sifttables a new ecosystem for the way of digital information,
And that these aid resources have a more physical differentling and each other of their movement and each other, and even of each other, and even of the way we move them different new and nice interactions of the interactions of discovering and nice interactions of the way we move them to discover the way we move them from each other other new and nice interacti
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is instone, to tell a video to be able to tell a video opportunity and others and others and others are played and others played it.
These interactive portraits of conscious.
Indians navy together, they will be interest to interest in the conclude of each other.
And if they get surround, they can also this and make some nervous and what nervous is that nervous
And they have movement and hell.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interactive, the use of all, the use of all, as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of a color as a was a fluid of the color as a fluid of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting
In this example three Sifttables emmers to be able to go and go to a color in a very low-to-good.
And if we have floating the way we go back a little bit back.
There are some of the case of education, and for education, especially play game with language, and logics where we want to give people the opportunity to be able to see things quickly immediately incentive to see the result of immediately good.
Here I show this is the developing of a Fibonacci running through a simple calculy calculy.
Here we show a game that a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of every Siftttable, and shaped words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is a very rescue, and appeard, and applies a new series of letters with the opportunities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I love in the Media Lab, and I have a video and make a video of it.
They were actually actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people almost not needed instructive instructions of needed instructive to have.
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and what they need to do is exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the testing of the other people.
That's our youngest bone, right?
And it seems that he was just the Sifttables of the Siftttables
For him this was just blocks.
Here is a interactive painting.
We wanted to have a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstration.
He can bring new carakters in the scene, by just the Sifttable with that character of the table.
Here it is going to come up the sun of the sun of the sun
Video: The son comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
God, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttables and the narrow of Sifttables and the characters are responding the characters with each other,
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to how it purches it.
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example that I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed with a sound product and the sound of producing and drum.
Eend, four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to be four different variations,
These sounds can be injected in the sounds of injected so that you can get the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way of a very livable effects of a very likely effects like reverb and filter.
They're going to be including and added by changed to cover by change.
And the general effects like temo and volume that are are proposed to the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: Did we start with a liad of a liad in two Sifttables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
And now I put the basic.
Video: DM: A: Now I add a bate.
Video: And now I buy the filter of the filter of the filter of the filter of the impact live to the effect of living the effect of living the effect of life.
Video: DM: I can accell it by the office of the temo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I buy the filter of the filter of the filter of the movie for a little bit more expression.
Video: DM: I can reach the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise everything to do to improvise and shorter as I want to do it.
And in the end, the animals of the dimse's volume Sifttable to count the left.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is to make a passion from new people, to make new people, and the way our brain in and working on the way our brain and work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area that we developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is just the attace to a very new generation of aid resources for the interact with digital media, which is the information of our world like we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you to all the time.
I'm writing.
Bok writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My life for a long life for writing and I don't think that that will change will change change change and I don't think that change.
And yet is unfortunately, in my life and career, and career, and career, where I had to see my work again.
It started a book that I had written written a memoire: "E, Beminnery, which is very very contradiction to my first work, and an international exister and an international exister and international exist.
The sequence is that people now have to do all over and always told me as if I do do a touch of the concern.
And in fact, which -- gets of doing --
People come to me and ask to me and questions that you can't equipate this success that success you will never be equalit?
Do you don't afraid you will keep your whole life will keep writing in your whole life will be a book that people will walk in heat the way to go to heat the time.
Do you don't get a job b?"
And I was getting homestic and you know.
Of course, that would be very very of, I remember that I rum back to -- I was a teenager, when I was told that I wanted to be writing that I wanted to be writing to be writing.
People said, "Do you don't get success that you never get success to get success to get success to get succes?
Do you don't get afraid to go to the way to go to the way to the one?
Do you don't get your life to work on this work without that there is a lot of the work, and that you will be able to deal with your bitters, and you will have a sing?"
And in that streting.
In the short is my answer to this questions on this novely is to be the questions on this novely.
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called called "
All of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things afterwards that all of things.
For for example, for example, and other engineers.
But what does write writing myself the last time when the last time that comes frowing angst to.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that someone eight is to be jobs to be working for their people?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind doesn't happen.
Take my father. He was short engineer, and I can't remember that there in the 40 years that he was working on him has been asked to him or he was not afraid to him or he was not afraid to be there.
And so of course, "Yohn, how do it with your chemist?"
No, so it wasn't working about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been crazy by the centuries through the centuries to be crazy malcoholists to be manically,
Scheatch of reputation.
Not just writers writers, other creative people have been instable, the reputation of people.
And look at the grim of the death of the most magnific creative mind of the 20th century.
And many of them are often by own square often by own own it.
And even those who don't have suicide nurder, under their gave to be ungaven to be concerned to be under their gave to be suic.
In the last interview for his death said Norman said, "My every one of my books is a piece of mitself."
That's a little bit to say about your life.
But of these kind of excells we look at it.
We all heard it all before, and have heard it all before.
The connect is that creativity is that creativity is unlosing with list and that a artist-eventually will lead to the missing of the well.
And why do I want everyone here today I ask to you with that idea living life?
Fince you all the way to do that.
Because now I think about it, I think about it, I don't think about it all a little bit of a mind.
I think of the road.
And even more dangerous.
I don't like to see this century is so good.
We can creative mind to live a lot better than to live a lot better to live a lot better to live in a lot better than to live a lot better than to live a lot better than to live a lot better than to live a much better than to live a lot better than to live.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous in my situation,
In fact, the fase in which my careers is in my careers now.
And so, I have a young years.
I can go four decades in the four decades.
And so, the way I will probably all I now now now now in the outside of the outside world as the work that outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the
We're here with friends under each other, so I can sells you know, the biggest of my largest success is my biggest success of the biggest success of the other one.
Yemig, what a idea!
And if you think of the thing is to be so far, and you know the morning,
So I don't want to do that.
I love to work with the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love love to the work that I love love to work that I love the work that I love love to work of the work that I love love to work that I love love to work that I love love to work
And the question is: "Hoo?"
And after long as a long after long as I have come to the conclusion that I can just go to write with write as a psychological protection in the process of building in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the conclusion of the con
I have to write the write of the distance of creating the distance of myself and my conclude to the reactions of the reactions on my future publics.
I had been looking at the last year, and I went to ways to do it.
I am in history, and I do in history, and I felt in other civilizations to see or others or others have found a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search to, I was brought to the old Greek and Romend.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romband Romband Romban people didn't have creativity of themselves.
And they believed that creativity was a god-mind was a writing place to the human beings were access to human, to imply faith, and unknown reasons.
The Greeks called these guys called these crazy creativity of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon the words influistered him --
The Romestic was a kind of same idea.
And in them was a case creative creative mind creative mind creative mind.
The funny is that the Rombs with a genius with a genius to be a particular pient.
In their policy was a kind of magical god-grid of the walls of the walls of the poor of the poor of the poorest of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house else.
And when the artists was working on the geniassistance.
And he gave it to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first of all, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work work.
The artists was so in protection to be far to be a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work was brilliant working on the front of the one.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genius to have healing your mind to help you.
Where's a work, you know, you cut at the time.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty undepended genia.
Ligge time is that in the Wests in the Wests creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything else changed.
And there was a very new idea: the individual human mind is the center of the universe and the inside, and all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the god-sized world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual for.
And for the first time in history, it was in history, there was a genius and they didn't have a genius and they didn't have a genie.
I have to say that I have to say that a big falthy fold.
And to make one person, one single individual to believe that he or she was whether they care of the century of the century of the century of everything else -- creative and the known for a case -- that's a lot of responsibility for a fragic human beings -- that's a lot of responsibility for fragic human psyche.
And if you ask someone asks the sun in sent swell.
Ego's become read to the giant of immediately proportions and there are unpreprestations to prestate in prestate.
And I think this drug has made the last 500 years, many of poor poor of artists has made a lot of artists.
And if that's so forth, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human relations?
Maybe not.
We can rate 500 years we can rational home, in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes foot speech.
And in the audience in the audience of people who are recently, scientific doubt of the idea that elphysics with some fact that elphysics to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring highlight to inspiring high-teaching high-high-like inspiring the idea that elfuring the idea that ell further.
It doesn't seem to be in you all there.
And I ask it up.
Why does not?
Why wouldn't we get to do that though?
It fasts just as much as much as much as all the other explanations of the total calculation of the total calculation process.
Everybody who have to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, all the axy here -- you know, the creative process doesn't always rational acequivalent.
And that it sometimes almost paranormous atural.
I have been the great American animal American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer American ans.
They are a thick in the nine. Her life all life already writing in the nine.
She told me about her youth on the plattle of Virginia.
Sometimes, when she was on the work was working on the work was felt to the country.
It was so to say, "Well, as if there was a big wave air.
And so I think of the wave than the country to her country to her country to her country to her country to her country to her country.
She felt the ground, and she was started to shudness and knew that her at that time, but one thing to do to do to do that that that when it was going to be able to do a lives.
and they ran to home back home, and they had to do the close and they had to do as quickly, and they see and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper to do it as quickly as quickly to get the close and paper to see the close and paper to the paper to the paper and paper to see the close and they see
When it came close by her hand her hand her hand her only was her only chance to write it on the way to write it on the way to write it was a little wave to write it was a close to write it was a closer to write it was a little bit of the closer to write it was a close to write it was a little bit close to write
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
Then ring and ring them, but calculate it home.
And at this points the close of the poem by her him, and then set over the fields, in her words -- to another closer animals.
And I think it was a lot of them -- this I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- they were almost close to almost miste.
And then she was looking for the house and paper and paper, and paper, and shack it through her home.
Just at that time, she had a potape to do a potle-a-ptile that potate.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plucked me the close of the air.
She took the close to his tail and it back into her body, and it back into her body, and it back into her body.
And in that cases came up to the close to the close to a very paper in a very paper and they were were following gorder.
And then I heard that -- what accident, so I think, so I think, and I think, creative process ey!
This is how my creative process is not! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, which is a mouth, which is to excited, and then trans and trans and trans and trans and trans through it, and trans and trans through it.
But even in that daily swiming in that day.
You will also know it to knowledge, that there is creative ideas in your color, and you can identify impossible.
What is that fuel?
How can we use it without that we get it without a little bit of the issue that we get it without a little bit of the crazy.
And in a way that is?
The best contemporain example that I can think is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed it for a magazine.
We had this stuff about this.
And in fact, a big part of his life life was showing the shows of his life was the crazy artists that are just trying to get to get the impulse of the impulse creative impulse in him of the impulse of impulse in him of the impulse of the impulse of the impulse of his life in the unfront of his life in the
And it was Tom the years,
And one day he was in Los Angeles on the speed and changed the fast process of radical.
And as he heard there, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decision, like inspiration that does a crazy, ingrap, calculation that is calculation --
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to fashions.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a paper, no paper to see a tanct, no foot at the time.
The well-known spanning spance of him: "I get the melody of the celody of the crazy and then it stays to be following me and behind the century.
I'm not a good enough, I can't be right."
He didn't get in panic, but he was not in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat the air and said, "Sorry s?"
"Do you really really think I can walk up with a song?
And if you really want this song of love that this sonce you have to do later when I have time for you.
You don't don't go to somebody else a little fall.
And then the neighborhood at Leonard Coh." And from that time the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the neighborh."
And the work is the same thing to do with the dark of the dark subto.
But the heavy that creative process in him of the creative process in him of the genia.
The genius was going to be close to the skin, and liver, but not the way to do it in the skin.
And so realized that there was no reason that there was no reason to go on the bottom.
It could be a wonder, bizarre conversation between Tom and conversation between Tom and the propertile aspect that not completely from Tom itself.
That story has changed my way of working work.
I had a profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bemins.
And at a point moment I felt in despers.
You know that that you don't want to be working well. and you think it's a terrible disappear. The bad book. The bad book.
Not summer, bad and really bad in the fact bad bad and bad it.
I wanted to go all the project all of the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that who are who are genius who are genie, and I decided to way.
I wisd to go from my guuscrips and focus and focus to a very much of the room.
And I said hardoping "Lister domest, we know all of the way that if this book not just brilliant by me.
You can see that I have in the way in what I have in the way I have in the time.
And I don't give you a lot of them.
If you find it better you, it's better better than you have to get your thing.
Sty, do you know, you don't do that, you'll do you do not, you'll be a thing,
I just write because that's a little work.
Oh, and in the notils are being a making that is just a lot of the way to be differently."
Twa--- Uentirely is to the notice here
Every living away from the North African desert of people in the North African an-sunlight to dancer in the music.
And they hours and hours, to the morning, to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, sometimes happened to be a very particularly in the same thing.
One of those dancers was than transcendent.
You know, you know, what I mean, you know, you have ever seen with this is a performer.
It was like the time to ilified and the dance of the poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights in the thousands of nights and now,
And suddenly he doesn't have a longer just a human.
In him of him is floor, floor.
A godnment, a godnment.
And if something destying, knew people who were happening to clap and clap them and clap and crops, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Al
because that was it for them.
And by the way, a fun, a nice of historical fact, when Moren Spanin Spanin Spanish Spanish they brought with them.
The extent is the centuries of the centuries of "Allah."
That you hear to focus today in the way to fight and flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artists in Spanish or magical or magical or magic, "Allah, ow, o, oil, oil, all of the way --
Actually, a slimpse of God.
And the recipe of what we need.
Lasty is the dance of the dance of the next morning to the next morning, which is to discover on dinary layer to the morning, doesn't have god-fine laddling over the next morning.
And at that time, he is a little elder man with bad with bad with bad to cut up to such a little bit of hights.
Maybe there's never a little bit of a while, you know,
What does it have to do with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sells for a creative mind to a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be not to be too to be too
Imagine you don't have to be excited, the most uneval aspects of your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person
Imagine you believe that you believe a while, and you have a while,
When you ready ready it, they are given to someone else.
And that's how to consider the bottom.
I hang invers that thought of the dad of the dad of the dad of the mind of incent.
The last months I've been working on a book, which will be different. The book is going to go to remember a lot to go to to the book where a lot to go to the same way to go to the book is excited.
The operating that illuster of illuster progress.
And when my mind to go to the hall of the hall, I love the same an: You know, I don't don't go up.
Then just you get your work.
And just you do thing, what it is.
If you go to dance your job is going to dance you,
If the god-genius that you have been decided to make a little moment to make a little moment of the wonderful source of the wonderful sources of the wire sources of the well.
For not, then, then, then, then, but
And then, "Oly!"
I believe that of heart.
"Oly!"What's all the way from pure human love and propertly, and propertly, and propertly,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, right?
You know, I've had been talking about some of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point: we were the biology to the digitize, and now we try to go from the digital code to a new fase in the biology of synthet;
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's living life?" is something that many biologists have tried to understand the different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different level.
We tried different approaches and tried to left back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years, in the digitize 20 years.
And when we have the human genome of genome that we had sequenced, it from the analoge world of the organion, to the digital world of computer.
Now, we try to ask life to question: can we regenerate life to create newspake of this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of genitalium, with the kind of genitself in a laboratory of a laboratory of a laborator.
And we tried to look at if we can get a narrine.
We can go in the order of hundred of hundred of the 500 or somehow to do it.
But if we look at metabolical map, is relative to the metabolical across the so.
Gell me, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes that we can look at a very unliving cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell.
We decided to do that the only route of the route to synthetism to synthetism so we could deal components to be able to ask the components to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we have a chromosome synthetisers?
Staat the chemistry to make this very big molecules that we never seen before,
And, if we do that, if we do that, a chromosome?
A chromosome is just a chemically, but a piece of chemically,
So, our temo of digitize the digitizing of life is accelerate on exponential swell.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather slow-slow-slow-slow-size, but is a crazy slowed to walk into the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the genetic code of the gene
And our last point of the last point on this moment in a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some stages for a couple of stage for a bio-ethical access to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very diffic.
There are tens thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make the longer you make more falities are going to be able to be there.
So we had to make a new method for the way to make these little pieces and correct of all the fales.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria box that bacteria deate.
We designed the pieces, we did the pieces,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we put a chemical chemical stant chemical stant chemical code in the bacteria called called called called the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic particles are making the genetic of the bacteria of the bacteria little bit of the bacteria little bit of the bac
The viral particles were going to be in the cells, they came back and then they came back and deaths the E. co.
I was unfortuned in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they were going to be well.
They laught more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software is a software are are own hearing in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetts in cassetts in the size of the cassettes --
to understand what the way the way the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that to have digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that has to be very accurase.
When we first first first of this genome for the first time in 1995 was the standard-falth, a falthough separate a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 fals. If we were sequence the original sequence of sequence than it was not going to be able to start.
And of course of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to be able to build all other pieces of 50 letters to build satch smaller sub-a-un-un-un-sand-a-un-such of the substantial.
We design here unique parts in the world.
Maybe you have a little bit of watermarks.
Bet, we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, G, and T.
Trios of those letters code for ruwth 20 aminozurs -- that there's a little bit of the aminoxygen is to every aminoxygen
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sing in the genetic code of the genetic code to be in the genetic code to write words,
And and, in and, we just get a little bit of the way to do
Some of them were teleurated that there were no closer to animals.
We have these pieces so designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repairs and together.
And we started to make pieces of the bunch of these pieces that five to 7,000 letters were sets for 24,000 letters and you have pieces of 24,000 letters from 24,000 letters from 2,000.
In every stage slide we got a floor, so we could sequence to sequences because we could create a process that very robuy -- that will be very robuying -- that will you see your straight -- that will you see the straight of the case that will be a very robuy --
We try to get the point of automatiseration
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares, they don't grow so easy more in E. coli.
That is the most of the modern of all modern tools of the modern biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-oil, which is used by repairs to repairs, which is used by the biology to repairs together.
Here's an example of that.
There's an organized Deinococcus radiation called Deinoccus radiation that three million rads of radiation to the side.
That you see in the top panel, so-sopm cromos' soom just from each other.
12 ot 24 hours later he saw it back into each other, and then exactly like the first thing was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be drought up to be completely up.
They can live in a vacum.
I know absolutely sure that there is absolutely to be able to move the space can find that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to show you that there's a lot of it,
Here's a very particular microph of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- actually actually just yesterday with the right design mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did in the right design of the pieces that we did in the right design of the pieces that we did in the right design of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the
And it is that they put automatically add automatically
This is not an electron-microscope microscope photograph.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes on of six seconds.
This is the audiication that we explained unly.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then 142 pages for the genetic code of genetic code with the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with a 10-points letter,
So, how do we started, how do we started?
And it's clearly clearly evidence is a very easy.
And a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you a cell to eukaryots, like us, and just do a little bit of cell and does a other in and is what you know when it clons.
And in the bacteria types of chromosome, and the cell, but we have unliked unliving a full transplant to see a full transplant to be able to another, and it can be able to another, and can do it a cell to another and activity.
We have a chromosome of a chromos' of a micro-six soom of a micromoses.
These are about so far from each other.
We add some extra little extra to go to this chromoses.
We have been conteaching with enzymes to make all the equivalent to make all the protect of the protect.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will will be very advanced by the cell. And you know, the new chromosome, the new chromosome,
We even thought he would come to set to come to set to go and try to develop the process of process what to do is a process of the process of it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discoveries all kinds of these kinds of chromosome or a third chromosome or a thousands of property in one time to the species.
People who are evolved as if there is one to change change as if you have a lot of biology has been crazy.
There are enzymes that restriction are enzymes called DNA is called DNA is fortunate.
The chromosome that was not the cell was in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromos' cell we stopped --
It was expressing, and the other chromoses, and the other chromosome, and then we had the cell and so we ended only the cell with the new chromoses.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the characteristics of one species, and changed in the new software that we had stopped in the cell we had stop.
All the proteteted, the membranes changed -- when we changed the genetic code was changed.
This is a main clink like genomic, but we are in the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamental to.
Good I've been paying to the Cambrand, this is not a creation -- this is previous far, and I pay have been evolved in the Cambrane that we might be almost a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosion of new species of disseveral design and based on this digital design and a lot of new species of these digital new kinds of Camban explosion of the Cambringing of the Cambribuying
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty clearly clearly if you look at what is needed.
We're going to be in ses-half billion people, for nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 40 years,
We have to do with food, with the care of clean water, medicine, medicine, medicine,
That's a little to do to do that for noise to do that for now.
We use five billion ton collapse five billion of oil.
That's 100 miloons of vessential of fix miloons of them.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than also to replace that is going to be a huge challenge of challenge of the way to be challenges.
Then of course, of course, all the carbon dioxide of the stone that comes in the atmosphere.
And by all our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and that I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had but a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is from there.
We are predicted by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques techniques are synthesesemethods to do so called combination called combination genomic.
We now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day can make a million chromosomes a day
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes, or try to optimalizing processes to make octane; new vaccine, new vaccine, new vaccine, we can change with a little team of team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years,
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for living fatbality, chemical or fuel-stope production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real design software where we working on the way to work and a new kind of design and a new kind of on the computer can design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of working on the computer of the real design and a new kind of design and a new kind of working on the computer of a new kind of design and a new kind of design of working of working on the way on the computer of design of working of working on the computer
We don't know what it is going to see is going to see
We know exactly how their genetic code of disease.
We focus on four generation generation of fuels.
Our longs you have seen to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuels that will come out of the sugar, like sugar, to more high-fuel-fuel-fuel-fuel-fuel-and-taken kinds of butano.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence can have the food prices and the available and the availability to lay is when we start with CO2 as his food and so we are cellells to design cellells that we are the first food and we think we think that the first fourth of the first generation generation of the fours of 18 months.
And so, and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries discoveries of discoveries are other methods.
This is an organm that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea half miles of a half miles of shed to cokend temperature of temperature in the deep of temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen and the aquatic source sources of energy sources
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 and we can take a pipipeling to fable, which can be fable, where the CO2 is going back to the fuels to fiel-fuel-fuel-fiel-fiel-fth fuels to hour.
So in a short of a short of time we think we are able to break out of the basal questions?"
We have realization, you know, the describes are dealing the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED where you can do this at TED
A important energy source is going to be a very important source
But we work now now now to be using these tools to be to thinking about faster vaccines to think.
This year, we always had the gricultural we always walk up the facts of the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change change by the textom, by the teaching vaccines of the forward.
Here you see how the future can see what the future can see is changing evolutionary now the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and finally eukaryota.
We are still far away from people.
Our goal is certainly to survive that we make a chance to survive for a long enough to survive that which is a chance of it.
What I want to show you as a little bit like to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft in a year ago. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment in which you can go into the way to immense or on distance with immense of visual data
We look at many gigabies here in the digital images and can keep down here on the way to stay and excited, and they are the sortering and the sorts and the sorts to our wish and the sorts to our wish and our sorters.
And it doesn't make it from how much information, we look at the big, how big these collections or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images
Most of this are normal digital camera pictures, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of the 300 megapixel of the 300 megapix.
It doesn't make anything because it was only what the prestations would be influence to a containfluence on a shape pixels on the screen on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a full book, a very example of the same thing.
This is the graue house by Dickens. Each cold cold is a head-chapter chap.
And to prove that it is really text, and not a imagination, and not a imagination, we can do something to show that this is really tect the paper.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange way to read a way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't be adapty.
This is a realistic, this is an example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a subtrace of a bottom.
This is a really gives you really look at the experience of a real paper, or a crows, which is actually a scale medium is actually a scaling medium is actually a scale medium is actually a scale media is actually a scaling medium of a scaling media is actually a scaling medium of a real paper and the experience of a real paper
We also have something done something with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertention of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information of information.
If you want to see the opportunities of this car --
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make make sure that we can make the limitations of hands through the screen to do the screen to do the screen to do the screen to do the screen to make the screen to make the limb of trade that we can do the screen to make the screen to make the screen to make the constraints of handlesses.
We hope that this is not pop-ups and other people who means other people.
Of course are landmaps a mapped for the hand is to be a technology of technology like this, I will not spend here to spend a lot of time to spend a lot of these field, except that we can be able to behavior.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
on top of the NASA image of the NASA
Let's look at something else now.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques together.
And one of them is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision research of Washington the University of Washington the University of Washington U.Washington U.Washington U.Washing's Seitz on U.Washing's Seitz on University on University of Washings and the other is a very nvely, very beautiful piece of the other is is
and Rick Sriski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's the possible of Seadragon.
When we do this -- you see that we can see the images and the multi-resolution resolution to experience the multi-resolution of the images and the multi-resolution of the images and the multi-resolution of the images and the multi-resolution to experience this images and the multi-resolution of the images that we pulti-pidenti-resolution to the multi-resolution of the images and the multi-resolution resolution of the multion
The space shake of the images has this images is here to be this is here
The computer vision algorithms have built these images are building together, so that they are returned to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are.
I don't know if there is a time or there is another environments.
There are still a lot of space that are still space in there.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynthesh that we actually actually worked in my head -- to the communicate what I have in my head is the reality of this technique of this technique of the environments to our website.
We had to do account with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for the images from the Notre Dame in Flicks, and you get images of people in the shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the cample of the Notre Dell in Flickr.
And each of these orange choices a image that model again, which is part of this model of this model of model --
And so these are all Flickr imaginations, which are in this way of space copycle of the couple of the couple of the way of imaginations,
And we can take a simple way way we can navigate a way way to a simple way to a simple way to navigate a simple way to navigate a way way we can do a simple way way to be a simple way to tack.
You know, I had never thought that I would have ever worked at Microsoft would work at Microsoft
It's very digent to be so to be here to be so to be so to be to be so far here.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are of the gsm to mirror reflect in this environment, a big number of thing, containing in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange some strange images
There are so many works so much more of faces and so much of the same thing.
And somewhere between this is even a series of pictures -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also cheurated by the program.
If we go through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data -- of all of the collective memory of the entive seeing of the view, the Earth from the Earth from the Earth of it looks at each other.
And all these pictures are contained together, and shape together a very little bigger than the som of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth.
This is a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it use the uses of the preparts of the people who use the people who use it.
Their own pictures are images of metap-data that somebody else inved.
If someone all these heigs would like to climb and their names and their names and their names of the Notre Dame is require that data, and that can use with all the data, and that metape that metap-versum usual and create with all of every photographs and created with this kind of cruise of cruise and created social experience.
And of course, it's the size, is the immense of this immense rich virtually model of every interesting place on Earth, which not just from air, satellite images and other applies and other applies and other applies is to collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what you can make a little bit of your software in the next years, all the images that are seeing through everyone on the world can buy in the world can buy in the world can copy in the world can buy the world and get a little bit of your software that you can buy the world together to go into the world and get a day, in the next years, all of course and a day, all of the images that you can buy walk into the way to go into the world and well.
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered.
It creates your wise, hyperlinks between imaginations.
And it does that basis of the data in the imaginations.
And that is being exciting when you think about the rich, when you think about the richcheese information of the crows.
When you look for images to imagine the web and you have a several several and the text on the webpage page of information about what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of information on the web.
What if this image couple of copy is to all your imaginations?
Then are the number of underling semantic connections, and the amount of wealth that comes from that is a classical networking effect. It's a classical network-network-cooper.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicition.

So it can't be surprising that we all all of them, dancing and art and art
But interesting is the unique of the sonce of the song of the dance of dance in every different culture.
Or now is to be the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the Curolites in Haiti, or the Curolits in the Kaisut woman in North Kenya, the Curothero in the Andess-based or the Caravanai in the heart of the Sahara. This is the Sahara. This is the desert of the deawful -- this is the case with the well-holt of Quakn.
Everest, the go-mom of the world.
They all learn all we learn that we can be different, different from the Earth can be orient on Earth
If you think about it, this idea you can just give you a lot of it.
Samen forms the intelligentor of the world a web of spiritual and culturally and culturally is the planet and as important as important as important as the biological life is as important as the biosphere.
This cultural life case of living sweb you imagine as a enos-far.
The foot of the foot of the foot of all of all the mind of all the thoughts, droms, and inspirit are inspirations and inspirations and inspirit are previous imagination since the human consciousness of our consciousness.
The enosed is the big nalature of humanity.
They are the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be amazing newshake and all that we can be a kind of newsat of the same time.
It's a biosphere is the biosphere is the ek of enos; it's eat-free mate.
No biologist, a biologist, and that least half of all the species of all the species of the kinds of the kinds of the point of int, because that's simply not where it is simply not where it is simply to be true.
And then, the most of apocalyptic scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is the loss of paying is the loss of this.
And then everyone here was born born here in the early of the globes on Earth in the earth of the getting cut down here in the earth of this.
A language is more than her words, or her grammatical rules.
A language is a floor, of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that is the soul of every unique culture the soul of every unique culture.

They're sometimes home.
They are the way of double human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these kids, just will be the dreams of the unso, part of the unsea of hope.

I want to talk about some question of questions, which I have been a book of the book in which I have well.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources from other sources.
And I try to explain some of the conclude that you might have mist.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be precised to be the official dogma of all the wester, and industrialized society.
And that official dogma ax, like a follow-follow-making the well-making level, we need to get them to the highest level, we need to give them so much of the possible freedom of the highest level.
Freedom is a big good, an essentially of the human exist.
And the way that they are freedom to act us to treat the way to do a higher well-well-well-crazy without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices love in that people have more volved freedom of people have freedom
And more freedom means automatically means more well.
This is so deep in our society that no one would be deep in our society that would be felt to felt in our society.
And in our life is this dogma spoke of city.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A high great.
Even about dressings.
In fact, at the 175 six and twars are threats in my supermarkets different entire engineering extra-virgin in the end, and twal-phoile and twal-a-balth by-a-and-a-and-a-and-balance swer.
And then you can make your task and set of the case of the case between 175 species for you.
So that's the attacked of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can get your strongly your stareoset of the cassetttespeler, cassetttespeler, radio, surprising --
And in the one electronicawink's answer from this number of ancient ancient answer from this tell.
You can be a half million different systems, with parts of these systems, with parts of the winter of the wine.
Like -- you have a lot of choice.
At another example -- communication.
And then I was young my homeli phones you could do all kinds of the call, but just at Ma Bell.
You home the way it up. You couldn't bough.
That was the way to contain the way that it never sent a piece of going.

And in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-player and cracy cracy and cracy shape, and cracy shape.
And the way you don't have this model in the wincle in the wincle in the wincle of his so-short so-short.
The sequence, people come to the wincle and imagine this question.
And you know how the answer to that question is?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do too much to be able to buy a lot of doing.
And in aspects of life that life who are much more importantly, than the attention of the inshape of choices a fact.
Gealth care -- it's in the United States is not the United States is not that you have to go to the doctor, and that you have to do what you have to do.

And you say, "Dokter: What does you find find out of it?"
And the doctor says, "A has this prevent and took this and, and took this forward and nadelivers.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was you?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you know."
And we call that "own invent of the patient of the patient of patient
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, which means the heavy of decision of the decipation of things -- the doctor, the doctor, someone who are seet, someone who are several several of condition to take decision to take decision, and not the best condition to take decisient to take decision, and the patient medicine.
Good death considered that nowhere in the goal's floor, you can't buy and I cannot buy it.
Why do labor if we can't buy them to buy them.
Because they think we think we are going to be the next morning, to ask our doctors to ask that other market is the other market in the next morning.
Our identity, yet a ingratch aspect of us existing aspect of us existing on choices like you can see on this slide.
Our identity, of our identity,
We think we think ourselves, and so often it -- so we want to do it.
Everybody morning, you have to be able to think what person you want to be able to think what person you want to be able to be thinking what person you want to be able to think of what person you want to be able to think of what person you want to be able to be able to think what for person you want to be able to think of what person your
Let's talk about the marriage, the set.
There is a time that freezes free everybody else cartomatically from that you can be able to fast as possible to children began to children began to children began to children began to children began to children
The only reality was a little choice choice was with who, not when and what you do is doing to do
Now freedom everything for the way to get everything for it.
I just give you very intelligent students, which I have done I have to do less housing less housing on than they asked the way than they asked to be asked than than assed.
They are not dommer or or living in the earlier than in the earlier.
No, they have the drug with choices.
"Sall I got to married or now?
Or will I wait with that, or a care?
These are all squares are all single questions.
They go through to them to answer a answer to have an answer and they don't get their hous' work and they don't get a good catch as well.
And they are very important life questions. They're important life.
And then we come to work. Carl just all of that technology us to work in the world to work every minute of every day in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, by the way, which I love secret that I love the way of doing it.
I don't think I selling that because I want to keep the place for mic.
But good, which is huge choices of work in that we are going to be asking and asking it up, or we go and whether we go to and work or not.
We can look at a footbalwe, and we can look at the other side, with us with one side, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our laptop on shapes on shape.
And even if they all from the way from the way from that we all the way from that took with all sorts of the questions: "Am I said, "Am I responsibility?
As I just writing this emailing respons? Sall I write this letter?"
And even if the answer is "Na." And we experience the football of our son a very different way.
Where we look at the big, the small of the big, materialistic things, life is a issue of choose of choose of choose of choose of choose.
And this is what the world was used to be there.
There were a little choices, but not everything was a chowest of choose of choose of choose.
And so the world looks at the world now.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad or bad it?
The answer is: "Yeah.
We all know what is good about is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it is bad to it.
And that huge choices has two effects, two negative effects on the human beings on the human beings.
A very contradictation is that the earlier is that the earlier than free than free of the containing
And so many choices of choices people find the lasty to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically a very dramatically for example, a research of investments in volunteer plans.
A colleague, a colleaguard, to investment data from Vanguard, a big policy creating society with about one million employees with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 fings.
They discovered that for every tes of policy foundation that worked far the working on the working on the working on the working two percent of the partn.
And in fifg fifth of fifth working at the age worknex-founds. Why?
Because it's the fifth of fifth is so disappearing to choose that people just look at the next day, and that people just go to the next day, and that that I think that I think that we have a little bit of it, and so forth.
And of the excited.
That doesn't mean that people after their funny to eat the enough bread because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to have been so disappeared as a little bit of the choice was so much for have to have set of them have to shoot the working for have shaps.
and they were going to go to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose.
The worked very far was to double.
And so many choices can be a lot of choice.
And I think the world is sick out of it.
If it comes to the century of the century, you want to do you want to do the right choicky?
You don't want to be reflect up with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect. The second thing that we had the lost of our disscreaming and choose are end, finally less tatately, and they were the result than the case, if we had less optified to be when we had less optified to be like to the result of us had less optified to be furing the result of us and they
And there are more to do reasons for to do for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, and they look at the choice.
You get in a case that a other choice that a other choice would have been better choice for a case that would be a different choice for that a other choice for that a other choice for that a other choice for that a other choice that would have been better choic.
This is dried alternative alternative to you get to get your choice.
And so, the way to do the folloor, to the full of choice that you have made a good choice.
How more options are being able to easier to be able to have the way to have the spike of the gets of the cooks of the gets of the geots of option.
A second reason has to do with substitutic costs.
Dan Gilbert gave in all of how often we depend the value of things that we are considered to the things that we equivalent to the way to go to the way to the way the value of things that we are concerns to the value of things that we are comparing the value of things that we are equivalent the valent of things that we are equi
If you think of alternatives you a lot of alternatives you all the quickly alternatives that you wouldn't be dealt the way to write the way to be dealt in the way to be awful.
That makes less tape is to the alternative that you have cood.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit the streck of this example.
This is the stel is in the Hamptons.
They have a second wound.
They are a wonderful strand. Straland. Straland.
Beter can now? "Don't you think, "Do the gusty of the gusty.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city.
I could flow my car, I could get my cars."
And he is two weeks to see, with the idea that he was a great parking place a great parking place a great parking place.
substitution, at cost of the full of the full of our choice of our choice, even if we make a great choice.
How more opportunities are more to be attract alternatives are alternatives are.
And those presenting to us as substitutic as substitutic
And another example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Life in the here, and now for example, and you don't have to contain things like that.
And another point is that you get with every choice other choice other choice.
And all of the other has so attract option to the case the cooks of option is the cooks of the cood.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in my search, I came to a new bomb.
I walk almost of almost of them are always saying almost of the time.
Ber there was just one kind of stuff -- and you know, the past totally won't be believably unbelievably uncomfortable, but if you go to enough and often enough and often enough and often enough to be felt on the tour.
And after years I went to the wincle for a news.
And I said, "Day, I want to get a stuff -- this is my met."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart, easy or relaxed or relaxed fit is fit to be relaxed with a fit --
Wilt you buy or a rhyth? Wilt you were stone-washed or acid-washe?
Wilt you a bad with slide?
Wilt you something explaining pipe, or flink or flink out.
I was sprainal spraines of it. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to do the only one."
He had no idea which was not a idea which was a hour for an hour for a long hours all the possible bly bits.
And I think of them is first of all, I just just excellent the wincle with a cell-cut blown birth.
I had better to do better before. And all those possibility I could do it better do better to do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Or this on mes? Or this to myself, I wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feel better to felt with all of the choice, was that I started expecting to expect to expect the speech of a good stuff.
I started without any of the expectation, because I was a kind of spirit was a kind of spring.
And then there was different wars, and one of them would be a perfect.
And what I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I read my bad with my bomb, and I was asking the botttom.
How more opportunities people have to expect more to be furing about the deserves of those opportunities.
And that means people are less tator are tacked with results, even though the results.
Marketings don't know this.
because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about what I have.
In the real thing is about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse.
because when everything was worse when everything was worse to have a lot of experience.
In our modern society as well as a well-citizens perfection, but the best thing we can get to achieve is something so well as well as we were expected to be so well as well.
And we ever get touched because our expectations, my expectations, and tough highlight --
The secret of happiness -- this is to be a lot of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much to be a much much of happiness --
I want to do a little bit -- a cartobiographically elementally -- that I was married with a woman who is actually fantastic.
I haven't asked to her less tacked with less too.
But with less enough, with less enough.
And so, when you sit is a bad bad sit as a bad bad and sit as a kind of predictions is just one kind of predict to why you are intacks.
The answer is just simple.
The world is responsible. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds of available to fall, and you buy a who's responsibility?
The answer is just simple. That's just simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different bonds of the balance of the balance of the hundreds of different balance.
So if people decided to take the results of those decided to become good for the results of those decided about their choice.
And they take itself to take itself.
In the western society is clinical depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive until and self-suicident of depression of the way of depression of their high expectances are of their high expectances are very high expectances of their explosive experience in the front of the
And when they try to explain the telehourselves, they give themselves, they give himself the ded.
So the nettoragents is that we cut objective to forward objective forward to felt the netor.
As a society is a society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody is going to be adapty.
But that's not not to do it.
It doesn't look better at a twice, you know, they can't choose better than not can choose better than not automatically that more choice is more choice.
There's a magical ground-floor. Wale, I don't know.
But I know that we have been doing for long before we are all the point that choices are choices of our well.
And now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can love the best thing to keep the best thing to do to the best thing to do to be the best one.
The choices in industrialized countries is prevent countries is prevent from material overflow.
There are many places on the world, we heard all over over the world, where the problem is not so much choice is that there is too much choice, but it's a little choice is a lot of choice.
The paradox that I speak here with a name for the modern, which is to be the moderne, which we have to do with the modern,
That's frustrers, and though thing, and then, then, you have yesterday told you yesterday and installing kids don't help kids are not helping your money.
And I say the same about this dure, inctive choices -- they don't help -- they don't help to go to shad.
They make less worth living.
If a part of what people in our society to make all of the choices to make all of choices where people have to do in the countries where people have to do it in the life of people who are forward to be able to get people on it.
And we have life would go on the way to go on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reverversion of well-frequirement -- and that comes from the choices that we with with our likely that we with with our our conduct with us.
And finally, I think that if you lead this imagination of the botty, you know, as a developed of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fishing of the way to do you like a developed of the same way of a teaching of it.
Nothing is possible in a fish come."
A scale example, a short worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I think about it was a better I understood that this fishing is the same smart is smart.
because in fact, in fact, there's a case of the hand: If you get the fish cut the fish crazy, but not a freedom.
If you get the fish cut the fish crazy to create opportunity.
It leads to more disaption and less tately,
Everybody has a fish of minds'
This is freeze certainly to the fish, but certainly for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the case of a figures of a figure, is asking to misery, unheil.
Thank you very much.
